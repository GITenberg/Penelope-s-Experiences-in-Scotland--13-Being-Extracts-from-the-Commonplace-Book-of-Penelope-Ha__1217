      Chapter I. A Triangular Alliance.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &lsquo;Edina, Scotia&rsquo;s Darling seat!
      All hail thy palaces and towers!&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      Edinburgh, April 189-.
    </p>
    <p>
      22 Breadalbane Terrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have travelled together before, Salemina, Francesca, and I, and we know
      the very worst there is to know about one another. After this point has
      been reached, it is as if a triangular marriage had taken place, and, with
      the honeymoon comfortably over, we slip along in thoroughly friendly
      fashion. I use no warmer word than&rsquo;friendly&rsquo; because, in the first place,
      the highest tides of feeling do not visit the coasts of triangular
      alliances; and because, in the second place, &lsquo;friendly&rsquo; is a word capable
      of putting to the blush many a more passionate and endearing one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every one knows of our experiences in England, for we wrote volumes of
      letters concerning them, the which were widely circulated among our
      friends at the time, and read aloud under the evening lamps in the several
      cities of our residence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since then few striking changes have taken place in our history.
    </p>
    <p>
      Salemina returned to Boston for the winter, to find, to her amazement,
      that for forty odd years she had been rather overestimating it.
    </p>
    <p>
      On arriving in New York, Francesca discovered that the young lawyer whom
      for six months she had been advising to marry somebody more worthy than
      herself was at last about to do it. This was somewhat in the nature of a
      shock, for Francesca had been in the habit, ever since she was seventeen,
      of giving her lovers similar advice, and up to this time no one of them
      has ever taken it. She therefore has had the not unnatural hope, I think,
      of organising at one time or another all these disappointed and faithful
      swains into a celibate brotherhood; and perhaps of driving by the
      interesting monastery with her husband and calling his attention modestly
      to the fact that these poor monks were filling their barren lives with
      deeds of piety, trying to remember their Creator with such assiduity that
      they might, in time, forget Her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her chagrin was all the keener at losing this last aspirant to her hand in
      that she had almost persuaded herself that she was as fond of him as she
      was likely to be of anybody, and that on the whole she had better marry
      him and save his life and reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately she had not communicated this gleam of hope by letter,
      feeling, I suppose, that she would like to see for herself the light of
      joy breaking over his pale cheek. The scene would have been rather pretty
      and touching, but meantime the Worm had turned and despatched a letter to
      the Majestic at the quarantine station, telling her that he had found a
      less reluctant bride in the person of her intimate friend Miss Rosa Van
      Brunt; and so Francesca&rsquo;s dream of duty and sacrifice was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Salemina says she was somewhat constrained for a week and a trifle cynical
      for a fortnight, but that afterwards her spirits mounted on ever ascending
      spirals to impossible heights, where they have since remained. It appears
      from all this that although she was piqued at being taken at her word, her
      heart was not in the least damaged. It never was one of those fragile
      things which have to be wrapped in cotton, and preserved from the
      slightest blow&mdash;Francesca&rsquo;s heart. It is made of excellent stout,
      durable material, and I often tell her with the care she takes of it, and
      the moderate strain to which it is subjected, it ought to be as good as
      new a hundred years hence.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for me, the scene of my own love-story is laid in America and England,
      and has nought to do with Edinburgh. It is far from finished; indeed, I
      hope it will be the longest serial on record, one of those charming tales
      that grow in interest as chapter after chapter unfolds, until at the end
      we feel as if we could never part with the delightful people.
    </p>
    <p>
      I should be, at this very moment, Mrs. William Beresford, a highly
      respectable young matron who painted rather good pictures in her spinster
      days, when she was Penelope Hamilton of the great American working-class,
      Unlimited; but first Mrs. Beresford&rsquo;s dangerous illness and then her
      death, have kept my dear boy a willing prisoner in Cannes, his heart sadly
      torn betwixt his love and duty to his mother and his desire to be with me.
      The separation is virtually over now, and we two, alas! have ne&rsquo;er a
      mother or a father between us, so we shall not wait many months before
      beginning to comfort each other in good earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Salemina and Francesca have persuaded me to join their forces,
      and Mr. Beresford will follow us to Scotland in a few short weeks, when we
      shall have established ourselves in the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are overjoyed at being together again, we three women folk. As I said
      before, we know the worst of one another, and the future has no terrors.
      We have learned, for example, that&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Francesca does not like an early morning start. Salemina refuses to arrive
      late anywhere. Penelope prefers to stay behind and follow next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francesca scorns to travel third class. So does Salemina, but she will if
      urged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penelope hates a four-wheeler. Salemina is nervous in a hansom. Francesca
      prefers a barouche or a landau.
    </p>
    <p>
      Salemina likes a steady fire in the grate. Penelope opens a window and
      fans herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Salemina inclines to instructive and profitable expeditions. Francesca
      loves processions and sightseeing. Penelope abhors all of these equally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Salemina likes history. Francesca loves fiction. Penelope adores poetry
      and detests facts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Penelope likes substantial breakfasts. Francesca dislikes the sight of
      food in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the matter of breakfasts, when we have leisure to assert our individual
      tastes, Salemina prefers tea, Francesca cocoa, and I, coffee. We can
      never, therefore, be served with a large comfortable pot of anything, but
      are confronted instead with a caravan of silver jugs, china jugs, bowls of
      hard and soft sugar, hot milk, cold milk, hot water, and cream, while each
      in her secret heart wishes that the other two were less exigeante in the
      matter of diet and beverages.
    </p>
    <p>
      This does not sound promising, but it works perfectly well in practice by
      the exercise of a little flexibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we left dear old Dovermarle Street and Smith&rsquo;s Private Hotel behind,
      and drove to the station to take the Flying Scotsman, we indulged in
      floods of reminiscence over the joys of travel we had tasted together in
      the past, and talked with lively anticipation of the new experiences
      awaiting us in the land of heather.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Salemina went to purchase the three first-class tickets, I
      superintended the porters as they disposed our luggage in the van, and in
      so doing my eye lighted upon a third-class carriage which was, for a
      wonder, clean, comfortable, and vacant. Comparing it hastily with the
      first-class compartment being held by Francesca, I found that it differed
      only in having no carpet on the floor, and a smaller number of buttons in
      the upholstering. This was really heartrending when the difference in fare
      for three persons would be at least twenty dollars. What a delightful sum
      to put aside for a rainy day!&mdash;that is, be it understood, what a
      delightful sum to put aside and spend on the first rainy day! for that is
      the way we always interpret the expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Salemina returned with the tickets, she found me, as usual, bewailing
      our extravagance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francesca descended suddenly from her post, and, wresting the tickets from
      her duenna, exclaimed, &ldquo;&lsquo;I know that I can save the country, and I know no
      other man can!&rsquo; as William Pitt said to the Duke of Devonshire. I have had
      enough of this argument. For six months of last year we discussed
      travelling third class and continued to travel first. Get into that clean
      hard-seated, ill-upholstered third-class carriage immediately, both of
      you; save room enough for a mother with two babies, and man carrying a
      basket of fish, and an old woman with five pieces of hand-luggage and a
      dog; meanwhile I will exchange the tickets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, she disappeared rapidly among the throng of passengers, guards,
      porters, newspaper boys, golfers with bags of clubs, young ladies with
      bicycles, and old ladies with tin hat-boxes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What decision, what swiftness of judgment, what courage and energy!&rdquo;
       murmured Salemina. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she wonderfully improved since that unexpected
      turning of the Worm?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Francesca rejoined us just as the guard was about to lock us in, and flung
      herself down, quite breathless from her unusual exertion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we are travelling third for once, and the money is saved, or at
      least it is ready to spend again at the first opportunity. The man didn&rsquo;t
      wish to exchange the tickets at all. He says it is never done. I told him
      they were bought by a very inexperienced American lady (that is you,
      Salemina) who knew almost nothing of the distinctions between first and
      third class, and naturally took the best, believing it to be none too good
      for a citizen of the greatest republic on the face of the earth. He said
      the tickets had been stamped on. I said so should I be if I returned
      without exchanging them. He was a very dense person, and didn&rsquo;t see my
      joke at all, but then, it is true, there were thirteen men in line behind
      me, with the train starting in three minutes, and there is nothing so
      debilitating to a naturally weak sense of humour as selling tickets behind
      a grating, so I am not really vexed with him. There! we are quite
      comfortable, pending the arrival of the babies, the dog, and the fish, and
      certainly no vendor of periodic literature will dare approach us while we
      keep these books in evidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had Laurence Hutton&rsquo;s Literary Landmarks and Royal Edinburgh, by Mrs.
      Oliphant; I had Lord Cockburn&rsquo;s Memorials of his Time; and somebody had
      given Salemina, at the moment of leaving London, a work on &lsquo;Scotias&rsquo;s
      darling seat,&rsquo; in three huge volumes. When all this printed matter was
      heaped on the top of Salemina&rsquo;s hold-all on the platform, the guard had
      asked, &ldquo;Do you belong to these books, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We may consider ourselves injured in going from London to Edinburgh in a
      third-class carriage in eight or ten hours, but listen to this,&rdquo; said
      Salemina, who had opened one of her large volumes at random when the train
      started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The Edinburgh and London Stage-coach begins on Monday, 13th October
      1712. All that desire... let them repair to the Coach and Horses at the
      head of the Canongate every Saturday, or the Black Swan in Holborn every
      other Monday, at both of which places they may be received in a coach
      which performs the whole journey in thirteen days without any stoppage (if
      God permits) having eighty able horses. Each passenger paying 4 pounds, 10
      shillings for the whole journey, allowing each 20 lbs. weight and all
      above to pay 6 pence per lb. The coach sets off at six in the morning&rsquo; 
      (you could never have caught it, Francesca!), &lsquo;and is performed by Henry
      Harrison.&rsquo; And here is a &lsquo;modern improvement,&rsquo; forty-two years later. In
      July 1754, the Edinburgh Courant advertises the stage-coach drawn by six
      horses, with a postilion on one of the leaders, as a &lsquo;new, genteel,
      two-end glass machine, hung on steel springs, exceedingly light and easy,
      to go in ten days in summer and twelve in winter. Passengers to pay as
      usual. Performed (if God permits) by your dutiful servant, Hosea Eastgate.
      CARE IS TAKEN OF SMALL PARCELS ACCORDING TO THEIR VALUE.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would have been a long, wearisome journey,&rdquo; said I contemplatively;
      &ldquo;but, nevertheless, I wish we were making it in 1712 instead of a century
      and three-quarters later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would have been happening, Salemina?&rdquo; asked Francesca politely, but
      with no real desire to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Union had been already established five years,&rdquo; began Salemina
      intelligently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which Union?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose Union?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Salemina is used to these interruptions and eruptions of illiteracy on our
      part. I think she rather enjoys them, as in the presence of such complete
      ignorance as ours her lamp of knowledge burns all the brighter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anne was on the throne,&rdquo; she went on, with serene dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What Anne?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know all about Anne!&rdquo; exclaimed Francesca. &ldquo;She came from the Midnight
      Sun country, or up that way. She was very extravagant, and had something
      to do with Jingling Geordie in The Fortunes of Nigel. It is marvellous how
      one&rsquo;s history comes back to one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite marvellous,&rdquo; said Salemina dryly; &ldquo;or at least the state in which
      it comes back is marvellous. I am not a stickler for dates, as you know,
      but if you could only contrive to fix a few periods in your minds, girls,
      just in a general way, you would not be so shamefully befogged. Your Anne
      of Denmark, Francesca, was the wife of James VI. of Scotland, who was
      James I. of England, and she died a hundred years before the Anne I mean,&mdash;the
      last of the Stuarts, you know. My Anne came after William and Mary, and
      before the Georges.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which William and Mary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What Georges?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But this was too much even for Salemina&rsquo;s equanimity, and she retired
      behind her book in dignified displeasure, while Francesca and I meekly
      looked up the Annes in a genealogical table, and tried to decide whether
      &lsquo;b.1665&rsquo; meant born or beheaded.

    <h2>
      Chapter II. Edina, Scotia&rsquo;s Darling Seat.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The weather that greeted us on our unheralded arrival in Scotland was of
      the precise sort offered by Edinburgh to her unfortunate queen, when,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;After a youth by woes o&rsquo;ercast,
   After a thousand sorrows past,
   The lovely Mary once again
   Set foot upon her native plain.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      John Knox records of those memorable days: &lsquo;The very face of heaven did
      manifestlie speak what comfort was brought to this country with hir&mdash;to
      wit, sorrow, dolour, darkness and all impiety&mdash;for in the memorie of
      man never was seen a more dolorous face of the heavens than was seen at
      her arryvall... the myst was so thick that skairse micht onie man espy
      another; and the sun was not seyn to shyne two days befoir nor two days
      after.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      We could not see Edina&rsquo;s famous palaces and towers because of the haar,
      that damp, chilling, drizzling, dripping fog or mist which the east wind
      summons from the sea; but we knew that they were there, shrouded in the
      heart of that opaque, mysterious greyness, and that before many hours our
      eyes would feast upon their beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it was the weather, but I could think of nothing but poor Queen
      Mary! She had drifted into my imagination with the haar, so that I could
      fancy her homesick gaze across the water as she murmured, &lsquo;Adieu, ma chere
      France! Je ne vous verray jamais plus!&rsquo;&mdash;could fancy her saying as in
      Allan Cunningham&rsquo;s verse:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;The sun rises bright in France,
      And fair sets he;
   But he hath tint the blithe blink he had
      In my ain countree.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      And then I recalled Mary&rsquo;s first good-night in Edinburgh: that &lsquo;serenade
      of 500 rascals with vile fiddles and rebecks&rsquo;; that singing, &lsquo;in bad
      accord,&rsquo; of Protestant psalms by the wet crowd beneath the palace windows,
      while the fires on Arthur&rsquo;s Seat shot flickering gleams of welcome through
      the dreary fog. What a lullaby for poor Mary, half Frenchwoman and all
      Papist!
    </p>
    <p>
      It is but just to remember the &lsquo;indefatigable and undissuadable&rsquo; John
      Knox&rsquo;s statement, &lsquo;the melody lyked her weill, and she willed the same to
      be continewed some nightis after.&rsquo; For my part, however, I distrust John
      Knox&rsquo;s musical feeling, and incline sympathetically to the Sieur de
      Brantome&rsquo;s account, with its &lsquo;vile fiddles&rsquo; and &lsquo;discordant psalms,&rsquo; 
      although his judgment was doubtless a good deal depressed by what he
      called the si grand brouillard that so dampened the spirits of Mary&rsquo;s
      French retinue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah well, I was obliged to remember, in order to be reasonably happy
      myself, that Mary had a gay heart, after all; that she was but nineteen;
      that, though already a widow, she did not mourn her young husband as one
      who could not be comforted; and that she must soon have been furnished
      with merrier music than the psalms, for another of the sour comments of
      the time is, &lsquo;Our Queen weareth the dule [weeds], but she can dance daily,
      dule and all!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      These were my thoughts as we drove through invisible streets in the
      Edinburgh haar, turned into what proved next day to be a Crescent, and
      drew up to an invisible house with a visible number 22 gleaming over a
      door which gaslight transformed into a probability. We alighted, and
      though we could scarcely see the driver&rsquo;s outstretched hand, he was quite
      able to discern a half-crown, and demanded three shillings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The noise of our cab had brought Mrs. M&rsquo;Collop to the door,&mdash;good (or
      at least pretty good) Mrs. M&rsquo;Collop, to whose apartments we had been
      commended by English friends who had never occupied them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dreary as it was without, all was comfortable within-doors, and a cheery
      (one-and-sixpenny) fire crackled in the grate. Our private drawing-room
      was charmingly furnished, and so large that, notwithstanding the presence
      of a piano, two sofas, five small tables, cabinets, desks, and chairs,&mdash;not
      forgetting a dainty five-o&rsquo;clock tea equipage,&mdash;we might have given a
      party in the remaining space.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If this is a typical Scotch lodging, I like it; and if it is Scotch
      hospitality to lay the cloth and make the fire before it is asked for,
      then I call it simply Arabian in character!&rdquo; and Salemina drew off her
      damp gloves, and extended her hands to the blaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And isn&rsquo;t it delightful that the bill doesn&rsquo;t come in for a whole week?&rdquo;
       asked Francesca. &ldquo;We have only our English experiences on which to found
      our knowledge, and all is delicious mystery. The tea may be a present from
      Mrs. M&rsquo;Collop, and the sugar may not be an extra; the fire may be included
      in the rent of the apartment, and the piano may not be taken away
      to-morrow to enhance the attractions of the dining-room floor.&rdquo; (It was
      Francesca, you remember, who had &lsquo;warstled&rsquo; with the itemised accounts at
      Smith&rsquo;s Private Hotel in London, and she who was always obliged to turn
      pounds, shillings, and pence into dollars and cents before she could add
      or subtract.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come and look at the flowers in my bedroom,&rdquo; I called, &ldquo;four great boxes
      full! Mr. Beresford must have ordered the carnations, because he always
      does; but where did the roses come from, I wonder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I rang the bell, and a neat white-aproned maid appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who brought these flowers, please?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cudna say, mam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you; will you be good enough to ask Mrs. M&rsquo;Collop?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a moment she returned with the message, &ldquo;There will be a letter in the
      box, mam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me the letter should be in the box now, if it is ever to be,&rdquo;
       I thought, and I presently drew this card from among the fragrant buds:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lady Baird sends these Scotch roses as a small return for the pleasure
      she has received from Miss Hamilton&rsquo;s pictures. Lady Baird will give
      herself the pleasure of calling to-morrow; meantime she hopes that Miss
      Hamilton and her party will dine with her some evening this week.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How nice!&rdquo; exclaimed Salemina.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The celebrated Miss Hamilton&rsquo;s undistinguished party presents its humble
      compliments to Lady Baird,&rdquo; chanted Francesca, &ldquo;and having no engagements
      whatever, and small hope of any, will dine with her on any and every
      evening she may name. Miss Hamilton&rsquo;s party will wear its best clothes,
      polish its mental jewels, and endeavour in every possible way not to
      injure the gifted Miss Hamilton&rsquo;s reputation among the Scottish nobility.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I wrote a hasty note of thanks to Lady Baird, and rang the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I send a message, please?&rdquo; I asked the maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cudna say, mam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you be good enough to ask Mrs. M&rsquo;Collop, please?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Interval; then:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Boots will tak&rsquo; it at seeven o&rsquo;clock, mam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you; is Fotheringay Crescent near here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cudna say, mam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you; what is your name, please?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I waited in well-grounded anxiety, for I had no idea that she knew her
      name, or that if she had ever heard it, she could say it; but, to my
      surprise, she answered almost immediately, &ldquo;Susanna Crum, mam!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What a joy it is in a vexatious world, where things &lsquo;gang aft agley,&rsquo; to
      find something absolutely right.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I had devoted years to the subject, having the body of Susanna Crum
      before my eyes every minute of the time for inspiration, Susanna Crum is
      what I should have named that maid. Not a vowel could be added, not a
      consonant omitted. I said so when first I saw her, and weeks of intimate
      acquaintance only deepened my reverence for the parental genius that had
      so described her to the world.

      Chapter III. A vision in Princes Street.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When we awoke next morning the sun had forgotten itself and was shining in
      at Mrs. M&rsquo;Collop&rsquo;s back windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      We should have arisen at once to burn sacrifices and offer oblations, but
      we had seen the sun frequently in America, and had no idea (poor fools!)
      that it was anything to be grateful for, so we accepted it, almost without
      comment, as one of the perennial providences of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I speak of Edinburgh sunshine I do not mean, of course, any such
      burning, whole-souled, ardent warmth of beam as one finds in countries
      where they make a specialty of climate. It is, generally speaking, a
      half-hearted, uncertain ray, as pale and transitory as a martyr&rsquo;s smile;
      but its faintest gleam, or its most puerile attempt to gleam, is admired
      and recorded by its well-disciplined constituency. Not only that, but at
      the first timid blink of the sun the true Scotsman remarks smilingly, &lsquo;I
      think now we shall be having settled weather!&rsquo; It is a pathetic optimism,
      beautiful but quite groundless, and leads one to believe in the story that
      when Father Noah refused to take Sandy into the ark, he sat down
      philosophically outside, saying, with a glance at the clouds, &lsquo;Aweel! the
      day&rsquo;s just aboot the ord&rsquo;nar&rsquo;, an&rsquo; I wouldna won&rsquo;er if we saw the sun
      afore nicht!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But what loyal son of Edina cares for these transatlantic gibes, and where
      is the dweller within her royal gates who fails to succumb to the sombre
      beauty of that old grey town of the North? &lsquo;Grey! why, it is grey or grey
      and gold, or grey and gold and blue, or grey and gold and blue and green,
      or grey and gold and blue and green and purple, according as the heaven
      pleases and you choose your ground! But take it when it is most sombrely
      grey, where is another such grey city?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So says one of her lovers, and so the great army of lovers would say, had
      they the same gift of language; for
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;Even thus, methinks, a city reared should be,...
   Yea, an imperial city that might hold
   Five time a hundred noble towns in fee....
   Thus should her towers be raised; with vicinage
   Of clear bold hills, that curve her very streets,
   As if to indicate, &lsquo;mid choicest seats
   Of Art, abiding Nature&rsquo;s majesty.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      We ate a hasty breakfast that first morning, and prepared to go out for a
      walk into the great unknown, perhaps the most pleasurable sensation in the
      world. Francesca was ready first, and, having mentioned the fact several
      times ostentatiously, she went into the drawing-room to wait and read the
      Scotsman. When we went thither a few minutes later we found that she had
      disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is below, of course,&rdquo; said Salemina. &ldquo;She fancies that we shall feel
      more ashamed at our tardiness if we find her sitting on the hall bench in
      silent martyrdom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no one in the hall, however, save Susanna, who inquired if we
      would see the cook before going out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have no time now, Susanna,&rdquo; I remarked. &ldquo;We are anxious to have a walk
      before the weather changes, if possible, but we shall be out for luncheon
      and in for dinner, and Mrs. M&rsquo;Collop may give us anything she pleases. Do
      you know where Miss Francesca is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cudna s&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, of course you couldn&rsquo;t; but I wonder if Mrs. M&rsquo;Collop saw
      her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. M&rsquo;Collop appeared from the basement, and vouchsafed the information
      that she had seen &lsquo;the young leddy rinnin&rsquo; after the regiment.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Running after the regiment!&rdquo; repeated Salemina automatically. &ldquo;What a
      reversal of the laws of nature? Why, in Berlin, it was always the regiment
      that used to run after her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We learned in what direction the soldiers had gone, and pursuing the same
      path found the young lady on the corner of a street near by. She was quite
      unabashed. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what you have missed!&rdquo; she said excitedly. &ldquo;Let
      us get into this tram, and possibly we can head them off somewhere. They
      may be going into battle, and if so, my heart&rsquo;s blood is at their service.
      It is one of those experiences that come only once in a lifetime. There
      were pipes and there were kilts! (I didn&rsquo;t suppose they ever really wore
      them outside of the theatre!) When you have seen the kilts swinging,
      Salemina, you will never be the same woman afterwards! You never expected
      to see the Olympian gods walking, did you? Perhaps you thought they always
      sat on practicable rocks and made stiff gestures, from the elbow, as they
      do in the Wagner operas? Well, these gods walked, if you can call the
      inspired gait a walk! If there is a single spinster left in Scotland, it
      is because none of these ever asked her to marry him. Ah, how grateful I
      ought to be that I am free to say &lsquo;yes&rsquo;, if a kilt ever asks me to be his!
      Poor Penelope, yoked to your commonplace trousered Beresford! (I wish the
      tram would go faster!) You must capture one of them, by fair means or
      foul, Penelope, and Salemina and I will hold him down while you paint him,&mdash;there
      they are, they are there somewhere, don&rsquo;t you hear them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There they were indeed, filing down the grassy slopes of the Gardens,
      swinging across one of the stone bridges, and winding up the Castlehill to
      the Esplanade like a long glittering snake; the streamers of their
      Highland bonnets waving, their arms glistening in the sun, and the
      bagpipes playing &lsquo;The March of the Cameron Men.&rsquo; The pipers themselves
      were mercifully hidden from us on that first occasion, and it was well,
      for we could never have borne another feather&rsquo;s weight of ecstasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in Princes Street that we had alighted,&mdash;named thus for the
      prince who afterwards became George IV.&mdash;and I hope he was, and is,
      properly grateful. It ought never to be called a street, this most
      magnificent of terraces, and the world has cause to bless that interdict
      of the Court of Session in 1774 which prevented the Gradgrinds of the day
      from erecting buildings along its south side,&mdash;a sordid scheme that
      would have been the very superfluity of naughtiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an envious Glasgow body who said grudgingly, as he came out of
      Waverley Station, and gazed along its splendid length for the first time,
      &ldquo;Weel, wi&rsquo; a&rsquo; their haverin&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s but half a street onyway!&rdquo;&mdash;which
      always reminded me of the Western farmer who came from his native plains
      to the beautiful Berkshire hills. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always heard o&rsquo; this scenery,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;Blamed if I can find any scenery; but if there was, nobody could
      see it, there&rsquo;s so much high ground in the way!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To think that not so much more than a hundred years ago Princes Street was
      nought but a straight country road, the &lsquo;Lang Dykes&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Lang Gait,&rsquo; 
      as it was called.
    </p>
    <p>
      We looked down over the grassy chasm that separates the New from the Old
      Town; looked our first on Arthur&rsquo;s Seat, that crouching lion of a
      mountain; saw the Corstorphine Hill, and Calton heights, and Salisbury
      Crags, and finally that stupendous bluff of rock that culminates so
      majestically in Edinburgh Castle. There is something else which, like
      Susanna Crum&rsquo;s name, is absolutely and ideally right! Stevenson calls it
      one of the most satisfactory crags in nature&mdash;a Bass rock upon dry
      land, rooted in a garden, shaken by passing trains, carrying a crown of
      battlements and turrets, and describing its warlike shadow over the
      liveliest and brightest thoroughfare of the new town. It dominates the
      whole countryside from water and land. The men who would have the courage
      to build such a castle in such a spot are all dead; all dead, and the
      world is infinitely more comfortable without them. They are all gone, and
      no more like unto them will ever be born, and we can most of us count upon
      dying safely in our beds, of diseases bred of modern civilisation. But I
      am glad that those old barbarians, those rudimentary creatures working
      their way up into the divine likeness, when they were not hanging,
      drawing, quartering, torturing, and chopping their neighbours, and using
      their heads in conventional patterns on the tops of gate-posts, did devote
      their leisure intervals to rearing fortresses like this. Edinburgh Castle
      could not be conceived, much less built, nowadays, when all our energy is
      consumed in bettering the condition of the &lsquo;submerged tenth&rsquo;! What did
      they care about the &lsquo;masses,&rsquo; that &lsquo;regal race that is now no more,&rsquo; when
      they were hewing those blocks of rugged rock and piling them against the
      sky-line on the top of that great stone mountain! It amuses me to think
      how much more picturesque they left the world, and how much better we
      shall leave it; though if an artist were requested to distribute
      individual awards to different generations, you could never persuade him
      to give first prizes to the centuries that produced steam laundries,
      trolleys, X rays, and sanitary plumbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      What did they reck of Peace Congresses and bloodless arbitrations when
      they lighted the beacon-fires, flaming out to the gudeman and his sons
      ploughing or sowing in the Lang Dykes the news that their &lsquo;ancient enemies
      of England had crossed the Tweed&rsquo;!
    </p>
    <p>
      I am the most peaceful person in the world, but the Castle was too much
      for my imagination. I was mounted and off and away from the first moment I
      gazed upon its embattled towers, heard the pipers in the distance, and saw
      the Black Watch swinging up the green steps where the huge fortress &lsquo;holds
      its state.&rsquo; The modern world had vanished, and my steed was galloping,
      galloping, galloping back into the place-of-the-things-that-are-past,
      traversing centuries at every leap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To arms! Let every banner in Scotland float defiance to the breeze!&rsquo; (So
      I heard my new-born imaginary spirit say to my real one.) &lsquo;Yes, and let
      the Deacon Convener unfurl the sacred Blue Blanket, under which every
      liege burgher of the kingdom is bound to answer summons! The bale-fires
      are gleaming, giving alarm to Hume, Haddington, Dunbar, Dalkeith, and
      Eggerhope. Rise, Stirling, Fife, and the North! All Scotland will be under
      arms in two hours. One bale-fire: the English are in motion! Two: they are
      advancing! Four in a row: they are of great strength! All men in arms west
      of Edinburgh muster there! All eastward, at Haddington! And every
      Englishman caught in Scotland is lawfully the prisoner of whoever takes
      him!&rsquo; (What am I saying? I love Englishmen, but the spell is upon me!)
      &lsquo;Come on, Macduff!&rsquo; (The only suitable and familiar challenge my warlike
      tenant can summon at the moment.) &lsquo;I am the son of a Gael! My dagger is in
      my belt, and with the guid broadsword at my side I can with one blow cut a
      man in twain! My bow is cut from the wood of the yews of Glenure; the
      shaft is from the wood of Lochetive, the feathers from the great golden
      eagles of Locktreigside! My arrowhead was made by the smiths of the race
      of Macphedran! Come on, Macduff!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And now a shopkeeper has filled his window with royal Stuart tartans, and
      I am instantly a Jacobite.

      It is the eve of the battle of Prestonpans. Is it not under the Rock of
      Dunsappie on yonder Arthur&rsquo;s Seat that our Highland army will encamp
      to-night? At dusk the prince will hold a council of his chiefs and nobles
      (I am a chief and a noble), and at daybreak we shall march through the old
      hedgerows and woods of Duddingston, pipes playing and colours flying,
      bonnie Charlie at the head, his claymore drawn and the scabbard flung
      away! (I mean awa&rsquo;!)&mdash;

      I hope that those in authority will never attempt to convene a Peace
      Congress in Edinburgh, lest the influence of the Castle be too strong for
      the delegates. They could not resist it nor turn their backs upon it,
      since, unlike other ancient fortresses, it is but a stone&rsquo;s-throw from the
      front windows of all the hotels. They might mean never so well, but they
      would end by buying dirk hat-pins and claymore brooches for their wives,
      their daughters would all run after the kilted regiment and marry as many
      of the pipers as asked them, and before night they would all be shouting
      with the noble FitzEustace&mdash;
    </p>

  &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s the coward who would not dare
     To fight for such a land?&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      While I was rhapsodising, Salemina and Francesca were shopping in the
      Arcade, buying some of the cairngorms, and Tam O&rsquo;Shanter purses, and
      models of Burns&rsquo;s cottage, and copies of Marmion in plaided covers, and
      thistle belt-buckles, and bluebell penwipers, with which we afterwards
      inundated our native land. When my warlike mood had passed, I sat down
      upon the steps of the Scott monument and watched the passers-by in a sort
      of waking dream. I suppose they were the usual professors and doctors and
      ministers who are wont to walk up and down the Edinburgh streets, with a
      sprinkling of lairds and leddies of high degree and a few Americans
      looking at the shop windows to choose their clan tartans; but for me they
      did not exist. In their places stalked the ghosts of kings and queens and
      knights and nobles; Columba, Abbot of Iona; Queen Margaret and Malcolm&mdash;she
      the sweetest saint in all the throng; King David riding towards Drumsheugh
      forest on Holy Rood day, with his horns and hounds and huntsmen following
      close behind; Anne of Denmark and Jingling Geordie; Mary Stuart in all her
      girlish beauty, with the four Maries in her train; and lurking behind,
      Bothwell, &lsquo;that ower sune stepfaither,&rsquo; and the murdered Rizzio and
      Darnley; John Knox, in his black Geneva cloak; Bonnie Prince Charlie and
      Flora Macdonald; lovely Annabella Drummond; Robert the Bruce; George
      Heriot with a banner bearing on it the words &lsquo;I distribute chearfully&rsquo;;
      James I. carrying The King&rsquo;s Quair; Oliver Cromwell; and a long line of
      heroes, martyrs, humble saints, and princely knaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind them, regardless of precedence, came the Ploughman Poet and the
      Ettrick Shepherd, Boswell and Dr. Johnson, Dr. John Brown and Thomas
      Carlyle, Lady Nairne and Drummond of Hawthornden, Allan Ramsay and Sir
      Walter; and is it not a proof of the Wizard&rsquo;s magic art, that side by side
      with the wraiths of these real people walked, or seemed to walk, the Fair
      Maid of Perth, Jeanie Deans, Meg Merrilies, Guy Mannering, Ellen, Marmion,
      and a host of others so sweetly familiar and so humanly dear that the very
      street-laddies could have named and greeted them as they passed by?

    <h2>
      Chapter IV. Susanna Crum cudna say.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Life at Mrs. M&rsquo;Collop&rsquo;s apartments in 22 Breadalbane Terrace is about as
      simple, comfortable, dignified, and delightful as it well can be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. M&rsquo;Collop herself is neat, thrifty, precise, tolerably genial, and
      &lsquo;verra releegious.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her partner, who is also the cook, is a person introduced to us as Miss
      Diggity. We afterwards learned that this is spelled Dalgety, but it is not
      considered good form, in Scotland, to pronounce the names of persons and
      places as they are written. When, therefore, I allude to the cook, which
      will be as seldom as possible, I shall speak of her as Miss
      Diggity-Dalgety, so that I shall be presenting her correctly both to the
      eye and to the ear, and giving her at the same time a hyphenated name, a
      thing which is a secret object of aspiration in Great Britain.
    </p>
    <p>
      In selecting our own letters and parcels from the common stock on the hall
      table, I perceive that most of our fellow-lodgers are hyphenated ladies,
      whose visiting-cards diffuse the intelligence that in their single persons
      two ancient families and fortunes are united. On the ground floor are the
      Misses Hepburn-Sciennes (pronounced Hebburn-Sheens); on the floor above us
      are Miss Colquhoun (Cohoon) and her cousin Miss Cockburn-Sinclair
      (Coburn-Sinkler). As soon as the Hepburn-Sciennes depart, Mrs. M&rsquo;Collop
      expects Mrs. Menzies of Kilconquhar, of whom we shall speak as Mrs.
      Mingess of Kinyuchar. There is not a man in the house; even the Boots is a
      girl, so that 22 Breadalbane Terrace is as truly a castra puellarum as was
      ever the Castle of Edinburgh with its maiden princesses in the olden time.
    </p>
    <p>
      We talked with Miss Diggity-Dalgety on the evening of our first day at
      Mrs. M&rsquo;Collop&rsquo;s, when she came up to know our commands. As Francesca and
      Salemina were both in the room, I determined to be as Scotch as possible,
      for it is Salemina&rsquo;s proud boast that she is taken for a native of every
      country she visits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall not be entertaining at present, Miss Diggity,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;so you
      can give us just the ordinary dishes,&mdash;no doubt you are accustomed to
      them: scones, baps or bannocks with marmalade, finnan-haddie or kippered
      herring for breakfast; tea,&mdash;of course we never touch coffee in the
      morning&rdquo; (here Francesca started with surprise); &ldquo;porridge, and we like
      them well boiled, please&rdquo; (I hope she noted the plural pronoun; Salemina
      did, and blanched with envy); &ldquo;minced collops for luncheon, or a nice
      little black-faced chop; Scotch broth, pease brose or cockyleekie soup at
      dinner, and haggis now and then, with a cold shape for dessert. That is
      about the sort of thing we are accustomed to,&mdash;just plain Scotch
      living.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was impressing Miss Diggity-Dalgety,&mdash;I could see that clearly; but
      Francesca spoiled the effect by inquiring, maliciously, if we could
      sometimes have a howtowdy wi&rsquo; drappit eggs, or her favourite dish, wee
      grumphie wi&rsquo; neeps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Salemina was obliged to poke the fire in order to conceal her smiles,
      and the cook probably suspected that Francesca found howtowdy in the
      Scotch glossary; but we amused each other vastly, and that is our
      principal object in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Diggity-Dalgety&rsquo;s forebears must have been exposed to foreign
      influences, for she interlards her culinary conversation with French
      terms, and we have discovered that this is quite common. A &lsquo;jigget&rsquo; of
      mutton is of course a gigot, and we have identified an &lsquo;ashet&rsquo; as an
      assiette. The &lsquo;petticoat tails&rsquo; she requested me to buy at the
      confectioner&rsquo;s were somewhat more puzzling, but when they were finally
      purchased by Susanna Crum they appeared to be ordinary little cakes;
      perhaps, therefore, petits gastels, since gastel is an old form of gateau,
      as was bel for beau. Susanna, on her part, speaks of the wardrobe in my
      bedroom as an &lsquo;awmry.&rsquo; It certainly contains no weapons, so cannot be an
      armoury, and we conjecture that her word must be a corruption of armoire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was a remarkable touch about the black-faced chop,&rdquo; laughed
      Salemina, when Miss Diggity-Dalgety had retired; &ldquo;not that I believe they
      ever say it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure they must,&rdquo; I asserted stoutly, &ldquo;for I passed a flesher&rsquo;s on my
      way home, and saw a sign with &lsquo;Prime Black-Faced Mutton&rsquo; printed on it. I
      also saw &lsquo;Fed Veal,&rsquo; but I forgot to ask the cook for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We ought really to have kept house in Edinburgh,&rdquo; observed Francesca,
      looking up from the Scotsman. &ldquo;One can get a &lsquo;self-contained residential
      flat&rsquo; for twenty pounds a month. We are such an enthusiastic trio that a
      self-contained flat would be everything to us; and if it were not fully
      furnished, here is a firm that wishes to sell a &lsquo;composite bed&rsquo; for six
      pounds, and a &lsquo;gent&rsquo;s stuffed easy&rsquo; for five. Added to these inducements
      there is somebody who advertises that parties who intend &lsquo;displenishing&rsquo; 
      at the Whit Term would do well to consult him, as he makes a specialty of
      second-handed furniture and &lsquo;cyclealities.&rsquo; What are &lsquo;cyclealities,&rsquo; 
      Susanna?&rdquo; (She had just come in with coals.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cudna say, mam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you; no, you need not ask Mrs. M&rsquo;Collop; it is of no consequence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Susanna Crum is a most estimable young woman, clean, respectful, willing,
      capable, and methodical, but as a Bureau of Information she is painfully
      inadequate. Barring this single limitation she seems to be a
      treasure-house of all good practical qualities; and being thus clad and
      panoplied in virtue, why should she be so timid and self-distrustful?
    </p>
    <p>
      She wears an expression which can mean only one of two things: either she
      has heard of the national tomahawk and is afraid of violence on our part,
      or else her mother was frightened before she was born. This applies in
      general to her walk and voice and manner, but is it fear that prompts her
      eternal &lsquo;I cudna say,&rsquo; or is it perchance Scotch caution and prudence? Is
      she afraid of projecting her personality too indecently far? Is it the
      indirect effect of heresy trials on her imagination? Does she remember the
      thumbscrew of former generations? At all events, she will neither affirm
      nor deny, and I am putting her to all sorts of tests, hoping to discover
      finally whether she is an accident, an exaggeration, or a type.
    </p>
    <p>
      Salemina thinks that our American accent may confuse her. Of course she
      means Francesca&rsquo;s and mine, for she has none; although we have tempered
      ours so much for the sake of the natives, that we can scarcely understand
      each other any more. As for Susanna&rsquo;s own accent, she comes from the heart
      of Aberdeenshire, and her intonation is beyond my power to reproduce.
    </p>
    <p>
      We naturally wish to identify all the national dishes; so, &ldquo;Is this cockle
      soup, Susanna?&rdquo; I ask her, as she passes me the plate at dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cudna say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This vegetable is new to me, Susanna; is it perhaps sea-kale?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I canna say, mam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then finally, in despair, as she handed me a boiled potato one day, I
      fixed my searching Yankee brown eyes on her blue-Presbyterian,
      non-committal ones, and asked, &ldquo;What is this vegetable, Susanna?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In an instant she withdrew herself, her soul, her ego, so utterly that I
      felt myself gazing at an inscrutable stone image, as she replied, &ldquo;I cudna
      say, mam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was too much! Her mother may have been frightened, very badly
      frightened, but this was more that I could endure without protest. The
      plain boiled potato is practically universal. It is not only common to all
      temperate climates, but it has permeated all classes of society. I am
      confident that the plain boiled potato has been one of the chief
      constituents in the building up of that frame in which Susanna Crum
      conceals her opinions and emotions. I remarked, therefore, as an, apparent
      afterthought, &ldquo;Why, it is a potato, is it not, Susanna?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What do you think she replied, when thus hunted into a corner, pushed
      against a wall, driven to the very confines of her personal and national
      liberty? She subjected the potato to a second careful scrutiny, and
      answered, &ldquo;I wudna say it&rsquo;s no&rsquo;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now there is no inherited physical terror in this. It is the concentrated
      essence of intelligent reserve, caution, and obstinacy; it is a conscious
      intellectual hedging; it is a dogged and determined attempt to build up
      barriers of defence between the questioner and the questionee: it must be,
      therefore, the offspring of the catechism and the heresy trial.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once again, after establishing an equally obvious fact, I succeeded in
      wringing from her the reluctant admission, &ldquo;It depends,&rdquo; but she was so
      shattered by the bulk and force of this outgo, so fearful that in some way
      she had imperilled her life or reputation, so anxious concerning the
      effect that her unwilling testimony might have upon unborn generations,
      that she was of no real service the rest of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wish that the Lord Advocate, or some modern counterpart of Braxfield,
      the hanging judge, would summon Susanna Crum as a witness in an important
      case. He would need his longest plummet to sound the depths of her
      consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have had no legal experience, but I can imagine the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the prisoner your father, Susanna Crum?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cudna say, my lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not understood the question, Susanna. Is the prisoner your
      father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cudna say, my lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, my girl! you must answer the questions put you by the court.
      You have been an inmate of the prisoner&rsquo;s household since your earliest
      consciousness. He provided you with food, lodging, and clothing during
      your infancy and early youth. You have seen him on annual visits to your
      home, and watched him as he performed the usual parental functions for
      your younger brothers and sisters. I therefore repeat, is the prisoner
      your father, Susanna Crum?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wudna say he&rsquo;s no&rsquo;, my lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is really beyond credence! What do you conceive to be the idea
      involved in the word &lsquo;father,&rsquo; Susanna Crum?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It depends, my lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And this, a few hundred years earlier, would have been the natural and
      effective moment for the thumbscrews.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not wish to be understood as defending these uncomfortable
      appliances. They would never have been needed to elicit information from
      me, for I should have spent my nights inventing matter to confess in the
      daytime. I feel sure that I should have poured out such floods of
      confessions and retractations that if all Scotland had been one listening
      ear it could not have heard my tale. I am only wondering if, in the
      extracting of testimony from the common mind, the thumbscrew might not
      have been more necessary with some nations than with others.

    <h2>
      Chapter V. We emulate the Jackdaw.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Invitations had been pouring in upon us since the delivery of our letters
      of introduction, and it was now the evening of our debut in Edinburgh
      society. Francesca had volunteered to perform the task of leaving cards,
      ordering a private victoria for the purpose, and arraying herself in
      purple and fine linen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much depends upon the first impression,&rdquo; she had said. &ldquo;Miss Hamilton&rsquo;s
      &lsquo;party&rsquo; may not be gifted, but it is well-dressed. My hope is that some of
      our future hostesses will be looking from the second-story front-windows.
      If they are, I can assure them in advance that I shall be a national
      advertisement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is needless to remark that as it began to rain heavily as she was
      leaving the house, she was obliged to send back the open carriage, and
      order, to save time, one of the public cabs from the stand in the Terrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you mind having the lamiter, being first in line?&rdquo; asked Susanna of
      Salemina, who had transmitted the command.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Salemina fails to understand anything, the world is kept in complete
      ignorance.&mdash;Least of all would she stoop to ask a humble maidservant
      to translate the vernacular of the country; so she replied affably,
      &ldquo;Certainly, Susanna, that is the kind we always prefer. I suppose it is
      covered?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Francesca did not notice, until her coachman alighted to deliver the first
      letter and cards, that he had one club foot and one wooden leg; it was
      then that the full significance of &lsquo;lamiter&rsquo; came to her. He was covered,
      however, as Salemina had supposed, and the occurrence gave us a precious
      opportunity of chaffing that dungeon of learning. He was tolerably alert
      and vigorous, too, although he certainly did not impart elegance to a
      vehicle, and he knew every street in the court end of Edinburgh, and every
      close and wynd in the Old Town. On this our first meeting with him, he
      faltered only when Francesca asked him last of all to drive to &lsquo;Kildonan
      House, Helmsdale&rsquo;; supposing, not unnaturally, that it was as well known
      an address as Morningside House, Tipperlinn, whence she had just come. The
      lamiter had never heard of Kildonan House nor of Helmsdale, and he had
      driven in the streets of Auld Reekie for thirty years. None of the drivers
      whom he consulted could supply any information; Susanna Crum cudna say
      that she had ever heard of it, nor could Mrs. M&rsquo;Collop, nor could Miss
      Diggity-Dalgety. It was reserved for Lady Baird to explain that Helmsdale
      was two hundred and eighty miles north, and that Kildonan House was ten
      miles from the Helmsdale railway station, so that the poor lamiter would
      have had a weary drive even had he known the way. The friends who had
      given us letters to Mr. and Mrs. Jameson-Inglis (Jimmyson-Ingals) must
      have expected us either to visit John o&rsquo; Groats on the northern border,
      and drop in on Kildonan House en route, or to send our note of
      introduction by post and await an invitation to pass the summer. At all
      events, the anecdote proved very pleasing to our Edinburgh acquaintances.
      I hardly know whether, if they should visit America, they would enjoy
      tales of their own stupidity as hugely as they did the tales of ours, but
      they really were very appreciative in this particular, and it is but
      justice to ourselves to say that we gave them every opportunity for
      enjoyment.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I must go back to our first grand dinner in Scotland. We were dressed
      at quarter-past seven, when, in looking at the invitation again, we
      discovered that the dinner-hour was eight o&rsquo;clock, not seven-thirty.
      Susanna did not happen to know the exact approximate distance to
      Fotheringay Crescent, but the maiden Boots affirmed that it was only two
      minutes&rsquo; drive, so we sat down in front of the fire to chat.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Lady Baird&rsquo;s birthday feast to which we had been bidden, and we had
      done our best to honour the occasion. We had prepared a large bouquet tied
      with the Maclean tartan (Lady Baird is a Maclean), and had printed in gold
      letters on one of the ribbons, &lsquo;Another for Hector,&rsquo; the battle-cry of the
      clan. We each wore a sprig of holly, because it is the badge of the
      family, while I added a girdle and shoulder-knot of tartan velvet to my
      pale green gown, and borrowed Francesca&rsquo;s emerald necklace,&mdash;persuading
      her that she was too young to wear such jewels in the old country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francesca was miserably envious that she had not thought of tartans first.
      &ldquo;You may consider yourself &lsquo;geyan fine,&rsquo; all covered over with Scotch
      plaid, but I wouldn&rsquo;t be so &lsquo;kenspeckle&rsquo; for worlds!&rdquo; she said, using
      expressions borrowed from Mrs. M&rsquo;Collop; &ldquo;and as for disguising your
      nationality, do not flatter yourself that you look like anything but an
      American. I forgot to tell you the conversation I overheard in the tram
      this morning, between a mother and daughter, who were talking about us, I
      dare say. &lsquo;Have they any proper frocks for so large a party, Bella?&rsquo; asked
      the mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I thought I explained in the beginning, mamma, that they are Americans.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Still, you know they are only travelling,&mdash;just passing through, as
      it were; they may not be familiar with our customs, and we do want our
      party to be a smart one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Wait until you see them, mamma, and you will probably feel like hiding
      your diminished head! It is my belief that if an American lady takes a
      half-hour journey in a tram she carries full evening dress and a diamond
      necklace, in case anything should happen on the way. I am not in the least
      nervous about their appearance. I only hope that they will not be too
      exuberant; American girls are so frightfully vivacious and informal, I
      always feel as if I were being taken by the throat!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A picturesque, though rather vigorous expression; however, it does no
      harm to be perfectly dressed,&rdquo; said Salemina consciously, putting a steel
      embroidered slipper on the fender and settling the holly in the silver
      folds of her gown; &ldquo;then when they discover that we are all well bred, and
      that one of us is intelligent, it will be the more credit to the country
      that gave us birth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it is impossible to tell what country did give YOU birth,&rdquo;
       retorted Francesca, &ldquo;but that will only be to your advantage&mdash;away
      from home!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Francesca is inflexibly, almost aggressively American, but Salemina is a
      citizen of the world. If the United States should be involved in a war, I
      am confident that Salemina would be in front with the other Gatling guns,
      for in that case a principle would be at stake; but in all lesser matters
      she is extremely unprejudiced. She prefers German music, Italian climate,
      French dressmakers, English tailors, Japanese manners, and American&mdash;American
      something&mdash;I have forgotten just what; it is either the ice-cream
      soda or the form of government,&mdash;I can&rsquo;t remember which.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder why they named it &lsquo;Fotheringay&rsquo; Crescent,&rdquo; mused Francesca.
      &ldquo;Some association with Mary Stuart, of course. Poor, poor, pretty lady! A
      free queen only six years, and think of the number of beds she slept in,
      and the number of trees she planted; we have already seen, I am afraid to
      say how many. When did she govern, when did she scheme, above all when did
      she flirt, with all this racing and chasing over the country? Mrs.
      M&rsquo;Collop calls Anne of Denmark a &lsquo;sad scattercash&rsquo; and Mary an &lsquo;awfu&rsquo; 
      gadabout,&rsquo; and I am inclined to agree with her. By the way, when she was
      making my bed this morning, she told me that her mother claimed descent
      from the Stewarts of Appin, whoever they may be. She apologised for Queen
      Mary&rsquo;s defects as if she were a distant family connection. If so, then the
      famous Stuart charm has been lost somewhere, for Mrs M&rsquo;Collop certainly
      possesses no alluring curves of temperament.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to select some distinguished ancestors this very minute,
      before I go to my first Edinburgh dinner,&rdquo; said I decidedly. &ldquo;It seems
      hard that ancestors should have everything to do with settling our
      nationality and our position in life, and we not have a word to say. How
      nice it would be to select one&rsquo;s own after one had arrived at years of
      discretion, or to adopt different ones according to the country one
      chanced to be visiting! I am going to do it; it is unusual, but there must
      be a pioneer in every good movement. Let me think: do help me, Salemina! I
      am a Hamilton to begin with; I might be descended from the logical Sir
      William himself, and thus become the idol of the university set!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He died only about thirty years ago, and you would have to be his
      daughter: that would never do,&rdquo; said Salemina. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you take Thomas
      Hamilton, Earl of Melrose and Haddington? He was Secretary of State,
      King&rsquo;s Advocate, Lord President of the Court of Session, and all sorts of
      fine things. He was the one King James used to call &lsquo;Tam o&rsquo; the Cowgate&rsquo;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly delightful! I don&rsquo;t care so much about his other titles, but
      &lsquo;Tam o&rsquo; the Cowgate&rsquo; is irresistible. I will take him. He was my&mdash;what
      was he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was at least your great-great-great-great-grandfather; that is a safe
      distance. Then there&rsquo;s that famous Jenny Geddes, who flung her fauld-stule
      at the Dean in St. Giles&rsquo;,&mdash;she was a Hamilton too, if you fancy
      her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll take her with pleasure,&rdquo; I responded thankfully. &ldquo;Of course I
      don&rsquo;t know why she flung the stool,&mdash;it may have been very
      reprehensible; but there is always good stuff in stool-flingers; it&rsquo;s the
      sort of spirit one likes to inherit in diluted form. Now, whom will you
      take?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t even a peg on which to hang a Scottish ancestor,&rdquo; said Salemina
      disconsolately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nonsense! think harder. Anybody will do as a starting-point; only you
      must be honourable and really show relationship, as I did with Jenny and
      Tam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My aunt Mary-Emma married a Lindsay,&rdquo; ventured Salemina hesitatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do,&rdquo; I answered delightedly.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;&lsquo;The Gordons gay in English blude
     They wat their hose and shoon;
    The Lindsays flew like fire aboot
     Till a&rsquo; the fray was dune.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can play that you are one of the famous &lsquo;licht Lindsays,&rsquo; and you can
      look up the particular ancestor in your big book. Now, Francesca, it&rsquo;s
      your turn!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am American to the backbone,&rdquo; she declared, with insufferable dignity.
      &ldquo;I do not desire any foreign ancestors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Francesca!&rdquo; I expostulated. &ldquo;Do you mean to tell me that you can dine
      with a lineal descendant of Sir Fitzroy Donald Maclean, Baronet, of Duart
      and Morven, and not make any effort to trace your genealogy back further
      than your parents?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you goad me to desperation,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;I will wear an American
      flag in my hair, declare that my father is a Red Indian, or a pork-packer,
      and talk about the superiority of our checking system and hotels all the
      evening. I don&rsquo;t want to go, any way. It is sure to be stiff and
      ceremonious, and the man who takes me in will ask me the population of
      Chicago and the amount of wheat we exported last year,&mdash;he always
      does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see why he should,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I am sure you don&rsquo;t look as if you
      knew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My looks have thus far proved no protection,&rdquo; she replied sadly.
      &ldquo;Salemina is so flexible, and you are so dramatic, that you enter into all
      these experiences with zest. You already more than half believe in that
      Tam o&rsquo; the Cowgate story. But there&rsquo;ll be nothing for me in Edinburgh
      society; it will be all clergymen&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ministers&rdquo; interjected Salemina,&mdash;&ldquo;all ministers and professors. My
      Redfern gowns will be unappreciated, and my Worth evening frocks worse
      than wasted!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are a few thousand medical students,&rdquo; I said encouragingly, &ldquo;and
      all the young advocates, and a sprinkling of military men&mdash;they know
      Worth frocks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And,&rdquo; continued Salemina bitingly, &ldquo;there will always be, even in an
      intellectual city like Edinburgh, a few men who continue to escape all the
      developing influences about them, and remain commonplace, conventional
      manikins, devoted to dancing and flirting. Never fear, they will find
      you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This sounds harsh, but nobody minds Salemina, least of all Francesca, who
      well knows that she is the apple of that spinster&rsquo;s eye. But at this
      moment Susanna opens the door (timorously, as if there might be a panther
      behind it) and announces the cab (in the same tone in which she would
      announce the beast); we pick up our draperies, and are whirled off by the
      lamiter to dine with the Scottish nobility.

  &lsquo;Wha last beside his chair shall fa&rsquo;

    <p>
      It was the Princess Dashkoff who said, in the latter part of the
      eighteenth century, that of all the societies of men of talent she had met
      with in her travels, Edinburgh&rsquo;s was the first in point of abilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      One might make the same remark to-day, perhaps, and not depart widely from
      the truth. One does not find, however, as many noted names as are
      associated with the annals of the Cape and Poker Clubs or the Crochallan
      Fencibles, those famous groups of famous men who met for relaxation (and
      intoxication, I should think) at the old Isle of Man Arms or in Dawney&rsquo;s
      Tavern in the Anchor Close. These groups included such shining lights as
      Robert Fergusson the poet, and Adam Ferguson the historian and
      philosopher, Gavin Wilson, Sir Henry Raeburn, David Hume, Erskine, Lords
      Newton, Gillies, Monboddo, Hailes, Kames, Henry Mackenzie, and the
      Ploughman Poet himself, who has kept alive the memory of the Crochallans
      in many a jovial verse like that in which he describes Smellie, the
      eccentric philosopher and printer:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;Shrewd Willie Smellie to Crochallan came,
   The old cocked hat, the grey surtout the same,
   His bristling beard just rising in its might;
    &lsquo;Twas four long nights and days to shaving night&rsquo;;
</pre>
    <p>
      or in the characteristic picture of William Dunbar, a wit of the time, and
      the merriest of the Fencibles:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &lsquo;As I cam by Crochallan
     I cannily keekit ben;
   Rattlin&rsquo;, roarin&rsquo; Willie

   Sitting at yon boord en&rsquo;,
     And amang guid companie!
   Rattlin&rsquo;, roarin&rsquo; Willie,
     Ye&rsquo;re welcome hame to me!&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      or in the verses on Creech, Burns&rsquo;s publisher, who left Edinburgh for a
      time in 1789. The &lsquo;Willies,&rsquo; by the way, seem to be especially inspiring
      to the Scottish balladists.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;Oh, Willie was a witty wight,
   And had o&rsquo; things an unco slight!
   Auld Reekie aye he keepit tight
     And trig and braw;
   But now they&rsquo;ll busk her like a fright&mdash;
     Willie&rsquo;s awa&rsquo;!&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      I think perhaps the gatherings of the present time are neither quite as
      gay nor quite as brilliant as those of Burns&rsquo;s day, when
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;Willie brewed a peck o&rsquo; maut,
   An&rsquo; Rob an&rsquo; Allan cam to pree&rsquo;;
</pre>
    <p>
      but the ideal standard of those meetings seems to be voiced in the lines:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;Wha last beside his chair shall fa&rsquo;,
   He is the king amang us three!&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      As they sit in their chairs nowadays to the very end of the feast, there
      is doubtless joined with modern sobriety a soupcon of modern dulness and
      discretion.
    </p>
    <p>
      To an American the great charm of Edinburgh is its leisurely atmosphere:
      &lsquo;not the leisure of a village arising from the deficiency of ideas and
      motives, but the leisure of a city reposing grandly on tradition and
      history; which has done its work, and does not require to weave its own
      clothing, to dig its own coals, or smelt its own iron.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      We were reminded of this more than once, and it never failed to depress us
      properly. If one had ever lived in Pittsburg, Fall River, or Kansas City,
      I should think it would be almost impossible to maintain self-respect in a
      place like Edinburgh, where the citizens &lsquo;are released from the
      vulgarising dominion of the hour.&rsquo; Whenever one of Auld Reekie&rsquo;s great men
      took this tone with me, I always felt as though I were the germ in a
      half-hatched egg, and he were an aged and lordly cock gazing at me
      pityingly through my shell. He, lucky creature, had lived through all the
      struggles which I was to undergo; he, indeed, was released from &lsquo;the
      vulgarising dominion of the hour&rsquo;; but I, poor thing, must grow and grow,
      and keep pecking at my shell, in order to achieve existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sydney Smith says in one of his letters, &lsquo;Never shall I forget the happy
      days passed there [in Edinburgh], amidst odious smells, barbarous sounds,
      bad suppers, excellent hearts, and the most enlightened and cultivated
      understandings.&rsquo; His only criticism of the conversation of that day
      (1797-1802) concerned itself with the prevalence of that form of Scotch
      humour which was called wut; and with the disputations and dialectics. We
      were more fortunate than Sydney Smith, because Edinburgh has outgrown its
      odious smells, barbarous sounds, and bad suppers and, wonderful to relate,
      has kept its excellent hearts and its enlightened and cultivated
      understandings. As for mingled wut and dialectics, where can one find a
      better foundation for dinner-table conversation?
    </p>
    <p>
      The hospitable board itself presents no striking differences from our own,
      save the customs of serving sweets in soup-plates with dessert-spoons, of
      a smaller number of forks on parade, of the invariable fish-knife at each
      plate, of the prevalent &lsquo;savoury&rsquo; and &lsquo;cold shape,&rsquo; and the unusual grace
      and skill with which the hostess carves. Even at very large dinners one
      occasionally sees a lady of high degree severing the joints of chickens
      and birds most daintily, while her lord looks on in happy idleness,
      thinking, perhaps, how greatly times have changed for the better since the
      ages of strife and bloodshed, when Scottish nobles
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;Carved at the meal with gloves of steel,
   And drank their wine through helmets barred.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      The Scotch butler is not in the least like an English one. No man could be
      as respectable as he looks, not even an elder of the kirk, whom he
      resembles closely. He hands your plate as if it were a contribution-box,
      and in his moments of ease, when he stands behind the &lsquo;maister,&rsquo; I am
      always expecting him to pronounce a benediction. The English butler, when
      he wishes to avoid the appearance of listening to the conversation, gazes
      with level eye into vacancy; the Scotch butler looks distinctly
      heavenward, as if he were brooding on the principle of co-ordinate
      jurisdiction with mutual subordination. It would be impossible for me to
      deny the key of the wine-cellar to a being so steeped in sanctity, but it
      has been done, I am told, in certain rare and isolated cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for toilets, the men dress like all other men (alas, and alas, that we
      should say it, for we were continually hoping for a kilt!) though there
      seems to be no survival of the finical Lord Napier&rsquo;s spirit. Perhaps you
      remember that Lord and Lady Napier arrived at Castlemilk in Lanarkshire
      with the intention of staying a week, but announced next morning that a
      circumstance had occurred which rendered it indispensable to return
      without delay to their seat in Selkirkshire. This was the only explanation
      given, but it was afterwards discovered that Lord Napier&rsquo;s valet had
      committed the grievous mistake of packing up a set of neckcloths which did
      not correspond IN POINT OF DATE with the shirts they accompanied!
    </p>
    <p>
      The ladies of the &lsquo;smart set&rsquo; in Edinburgh wear French fripperies and
      chiffons, as do their sisters every where, but the other women of society
      dress a trifle more staidly than their cousins in London, Paris, or New
      York. The sobriety of taste and severity of style that characterise
      Scotswomen may be due, like Susanna Crum&rsquo;s dubieties, to the haar, to the
      shorter catechism, or perhaps in some degree to the presence of three
      branches of the Presbyterian Church among them; the society that bears in
      its bosom three separate and antagonistic kinds of Presbyterianism at the
      same time must have its chilly moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Lord Cockburn&rsquo;s time the &lsquo;dames of high and aristocratic breed&rsquo; must
      have been sufficiently awake to feminine frivolities to be both gorgeously
      and extravagantly arrayed. I do not know in all literature a more
      delicious and lifelike word-portrait than Lord Cockburn gives of Mrs.
      Rochead, the Lady of Inverleith, in the Memorials. It is quite worthy to
      hang beside a Raeburn canvas; one can scarce say more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Except Mrs. Siddons in some of her displays of magnificent royalty,
      nobody could sit down like the Lady of Inverleith. She would sail like a
      ship from Tarshish, gorgeous in velvet or rustling silk, done up in all
      the accompaniments of fans, ear-rings, and finger-rings, falling sleeves,
      scent-bottle, embroidered bag, hoop, and train; managing all this
      seemingly heavy rigging with as much ease as a full-blown swan does its
      plumage. She would take possession of the centre of a large sofa, and at
      the same moment, without the slightest visible exertion, cover the whole
      of it with her bravery, the graceful folds seeming to lay themselves over
      it, like summer waves. The descent from her carriage, too, where she sat
      like a nautilus in its shell, was a display which no one in these days
      could accomplish or even fancy. The mulberry-coloured coach, apparently
      not too large for what it contained, though she alone was in it; the
      handsome, jolly coachman and his splendid hammer-cloth loaded with lace;
      the two respectful liveried footmen, one on each side of the richly
      carpeted step,&mdash;these were lost sight of amidst the slow majesty with
      which the Lady of Inverleith came down and touched the earth.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      My right-hand neighbour at Lady Baird&rsquo;s dinner was surprised at my quoting
      Lord Cockburn. One&rsquo;s attendant squires here always seem surprised when one
      knows anything; but they are always delighted, too, so that the amazement
      is less trying. True, I had read the Memorials only the week before, and
      had never heard of them previous to that time; but that detail, according
      to my theories, makes no real difference. The woman who knows how and when
      to &lsquo;read up,&rsquo; who reads because she wants to be in sympathy with a new
      environment; the woman who has wit and perspective enough to be stimulated
      by novel conditions and kindled by fresh influences, who is susceptible to
      the vibrations of other people&rsquo;s history, is safe to be fairly intelligent
      and extremely agreeable, if only she is sufficiently modest. I think my
      neighbour found me thoroughly delightful after he discovered my point of
      view. He was an earl; and it always takes an earl a certain length of time
      to understand me. I scarcely know why, for I certainly should not think it
      courteous to interpose any real barriers between the nobility and that
      portion of the &lsquo;masses&rsquo; represented in my humble person.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to me at first that the earl did not apply himself to the study
      of my national peculiarities with much assiduity, but wasted considerable
      time in gazing at Francesca, who was opposite. She is certainly very
      handsome, and I never saw her lovelier than at that dinner; her eyes were
      like stars, and her cheeks and lips a splendid crimson, for she was
      quarrelling with her attendant cavalier about the relative merits of
      Scotland and America, and they apparently ceased to speak to each other
      after the salad.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the earl had sufficiently piqued me by his devotion to his dinner and
      his glances at Francesca, I began a systematic attempt to achieve his
      (transient) subjugation. Of course I am ardently attached to Willie
      Beresford and prefer him to any earl in Britain, but one&rsquo;s self-respect
      demands something in the way of food. I could see Salemina at the far end
      of the table radiant with success, the W.S. at her side bending ever and
      anon to catch the (artificial) pearls of thought that dropped from her
      lips. &ldquo;Miss Hamilton appears simple&rdquo; (I thought I heard her say); &ldquo;but in
      reality she is as deep as the Currie Brig!&rdquo; Now where did she get that
      allusion? And again, when the W.S. asked her whither she was going when
      she left Edinburgh, &ldquo;I hardly know,&rdquo; she replied pensively. &ldquo;I am waiting
      for the shade of Montrose to direct me, as the Viscount Dundee said to
      your Duke of Gordon.&rdquo; The entranced Scotsman little knew that she had
      perfected this style of conversation by long experience with the Q.C.&lsquo;s of
      England. Talk about my being as deep as the Currie Brig (whatever it may
      be); Salemina is deeper than the Atlantic Ocean! I shall take pains to
      inform her Writer to the Signet, after dinner, that she eats sugar on her
      porridge every morning; that will show him her nationality conclusively.
    </p>
    <p>
      The earl took the greatest interest in my new ancestors, and approved
      thoroughly of my choice. He thinks I must have been named for Lady
      Penelope Belhaven, who lived in Leven Lodge, one of the country villas of
      the Earls of Leven, from whom he himself is descended. &ldquo;Does that make us
      relatives?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Relatives, most assuredly,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;but not too
      near to destroy the charm of friendship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He thought it a great deal nicer to select one&rsquo;s own forebears than to
      allow them all the responsibility, and said it would save a world of
      trouble if the method could be universally adopted. He added that he
      should be glad to part with a good many of his, but doubted whether I
      would accept them, as they were &lsquo;rather a scratch lot.&rsquo; (I use his own
      language, which I thought delightfully easy for a belted earl.) He was
      charmed with the story of Francesca and the lamiter, and offered to drive
      me to Kildonan House, Helmsdale, on the first fine day. I told him he was
      quite safe in making the proposition, for we had already had the fine day,
      and we understood that the climate had exhausted itself and retired for
      the season.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman on my left, a distinguished Dean of the Thistle, gave me a
      few moments&rsquo; discomfort by telling me that the old custom of &lsquo;rounds&rsquo; of
      toasts still prevailed at Lady Baird&rsquo;s on formal occasions, and that
      before the ladies retired every one would be called upon for appropriate
      &lsquo;sentiments.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of sentiments?&rdquo; I inquired, quite overcome with terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, epigrammatic sentences expressive of moral feelings or virtues,&rdquo;
       replied my neighbour easily. &ldquo;They are not quite as formal and hackneyed
      now as they were in the olden time, when some of the favourite toasts were
      &lsquo;May the pleasure of the evening bear the reflections of the morning!&rsquo; 
      &lsquo;May the friends of our youth be the companions of our old age!&rsquo; &lsquo;May the
      honest heart never feel distress!&rsquo; &lsquo;May the hand of charity wipe the eye
      of sorrow!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can never do it in the world!&rdquo; I ejaculated. &ldquo;Oh, one ought never,
      never to leave one&rsquo;s own country! A light-minded and cynical English
      gentleman told me that I should frequently be called upon to read hymns
      and recite verses of Scripture at family dinners in Edinburgh, and I hope
      I am always prepared to do that; but nobody warned me that I should have
      to evolve epigrammatic sentiments on the spur of the moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My confusion was so evident that the good dean relented and confessed that
      he was imposing upon my ignorance. He made me laugh heartily at the story
      of a poor dominie at Arndilly. He was called upon in his turn, at a large
      party, and having nothing to aid him in an exercise to which he was new
      save the example of his predecessors, lifted his glass after much writhing
      and groaning and gave, &ldquo;The reflection of the moon in the cawm bosom of
      the lake!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Lady Baird glanced at me, and we all rose to go into the
      drawing-room; but on the way from my chair to the door, whither the earl
      escorted me, he said gallantly, &ldquo;I suppose the men in your country do not
      take champagne at dinner? I cannot fancy their craving it when dining
      beside an American woman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was charming, though he did pay my country a compliment at my
      expense. One likes, of course, to have the type recognised as fine; at the
      same time his remark would have been more flattering if it had been less
      sweeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I remember that he offered me his ancestors, asked me to drive two
      hundred and eighty miles, and likened me to champagne, I feel that, with
      my heart already occupied and my hand promised, I could hardly have
      accomplished more in the course of a single dinner-hour.

    <h2>
      Chapter VII. Francesca meets th&rsquo; unconquer&rsquo;d Scot.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Francesca&rsquo;s experiences were not so fortunate; indeed, I have never seen
      her more out of sorts than she was during our long chat over the fire,
      after our return to Breadalbane Terrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you get on with your delightful minister?&rdquo; inquired Salemina of
      the young lady, as she flung her unoffending wrap over the back of a
      chair. &ldquo;He was quite the handsomest man in the room; who is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is the Reverend Ronald Macdonald, and the most disagreeable,
      condescending, ill-tempered prig I ever met!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Francesca!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;Lady Baird speaks of him as her favourite
      nephew, and says he is full of charm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is just as full of charm as he was when I met him,&rdquo; returned the girl
      nonchalantly; &ldquo;that is, he parted with none of it this evening. He was
      incorrigibly stiff and rude, and oh! so Scotch! I believe if one punctured
      him with a hat-pin, oatmeal would fly into the air!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless you acquainted him, early in the evening, with the immeasurable
      advantages of our sleeping-car system, the superiority of our fast-running
      elevators, and the height of our buildings?&rdquo; observed Salemina.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mentioned them,&rdquo; Francesca answered evasively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You naturally inveighed against the Scotch climate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I alluded to it; but only when he said that our hot summers must be
      insufferable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you repeated the remark you made at luncheon, that the ladies
      you had seen in Princes Street were excessively plain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I did!&rdquo; she replied hotly; &ldquo;but that was because he said that
      American girls generally looked bloodless and frail. He asked if it were
      really true that they ate chalk and slate pencils. Wasn&rsquo;t that
      unendurable? I answered that those were the chief solid article of food,
      but that after their complexions were established, so to speak, their
      parents often allowed them pickles and native claret to vary the diet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he say to that?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he said, &lsquo;Quite so, quite so&rsquo;; that was his invariable response to
      all my witticisms. Then when I told him casually that the shops looked
      very small and dark and stuffy here, and that there were not as many
      tartans and plaids in the windows as we had expected, he remarked that as
      to the latter point, the American season had not opened yet! Presently he
      asserted that no royal city in Europe could boast ten centuries of such
      glorious and stirring history as Edinburgh. I said it did not appear to be
      stirring much at present, and that everything in Scotland seemed a little
      slow to an American; that he could have no idea of push or enterprise
      until he visited a city like Chicago. He retorted that, happily, Edinburgh
      was peculiarly free from the taint of the ledger and the counting-house;
      that it was Weimar without a Goethe, Boston without its twang!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Incredible!&rdquo; cried Salemina, deeply wounded in her local pride. &ldquo;He never
      could have said &lsquo;twang&rsquo; unless you had tried him beyond measure!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say I did; he is easily tried,&rdquo; returned Francesca. &ldquo;I asked him,
      sarcastically, if he had ever been in Boston. &lsquo;No,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;it is not
      necessary to GO there! And while we are discussing these matters,&rsquo; he went
      on, &lsquo;how is your American dyspepsia these days,&mdash;have you decided
      what is the cause of it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, we have,&rsquo; said I, as quick as a flash; &lsquo;we have always taken in
      more foreigners than we could assimilate!&rsquo; I wanted to tell him that one
      Scotsman of his type would upset the national digestion anywhere, but I
      restrained myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad you did restrain yourself&mdash;once,&rdquo; exclaimed Salemina.
      &ldquo;What a tactful person the Reverend Ronald must be, if you have reported
      him faithfully! Why didn&rsquo;t you give him up, and turn to your other
      neighbour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did, as soon as I could with courtesy; but the man on my left was the
      type that always haunts me at dinners; if the hostess hasn&rsquo;t one on her
      visiting-list she imports one for the occasion. He asked me at once of
      what material the Brooklyn Bridge is made. I told him I really didn&rsquo;t
      know. Why should I? I seldom go over it. Then he asked me whether it was a
      suspension bridge or a cantilever. Of course I didn&rsquo;t know; I am not an
      engineer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are so tactlessly, needlessly candid,&rdquo; I expostulated. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t
      you say boldly that the Brooklyn Bridge is a wooden cantilever, with
      gutta-percha braces? He didn&rsquo;t know, or he wouldn&rsquo;t have asked you. He
      couldn&rsquo;t find out until he reached home, and you would never have seen him
      again; and if you had, and he had taunted you, you could have laughed
      vivaciously and said you were chaffing. That is my method, and it is the
      only way to preserve life in a foreign country. Even my earl, who did not
      thirst for information (fortunately), asked me the population of the
      Yellowstone Park, and I simply told him three hundred thousand, at a
      venture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would never have satisfied my neighbour,&rdquo; said Francesca. &ldquo;Finding
      me in such a lamentable state of ignorance, he explained the principle of
      his own stupid Forth Bridge to me. When I said I understood perfectly,
      just to get into shallower water, where we wouldn&rsquo;t need any bridge, the
      Reverend Ronald joined in the conversation, and asked me to repeat the
      explanation to him. Naturally I couldn&rsquo;t, and he knew that I couldn&rsquo;t when
      he asked me, so the bridge man (I don&rsquo;t know his name, and don&rsquo;t care to
      know it) drew a diagram of the national idol on his dinner-card and gave a
      dull and elaborate lecture upon it. Here is the card, and now that three
      hours have intervened I cannot tell which way to turn the drawing so as to
      make the bridge right side up; if there is anything puzzling in the world,
      it is these architectural plans and diagrams. I am going to pin it to the
      wall and ask the Reverend Ronald which way it goes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that he will call upon us?&rdquo; we cried in concert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He asked if he might come and continue our &lsquo;stimulating&rsquo; conversation,
      and as Lady Baird was standing by I could hardly say no. I am sure of one
      thing: that before I finish with him I will widen his horizon so that he
      will be able to see something beside Scotland and his little insignificant
      Fifeshire parish! I told him our country parishes in America were ten
      times as large as his. He said he had heard that they covered a good deal
      of territory, and that the ministers&rsquo; salaries were sometimes paid in pork
      and potatoes. That shows you the style of his retorts!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really cannot decide which of you was the more disagreeable,&rdquo; said
      Salemina; &ldquo;if he calls, I shall not remain in the room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t gratify him by staying out,&rdquo; retorted Francesca. &ldquo;He is
      extremely good for the circulation; I think I was never so warm in my life
      as when I talked with him; as physical exercise he is equal to bicycling.
      The bridge man is coming to call, too. I made him a diagram of Breadalbane
      Terrace, and a plan of the hall and staircase, on my dinner-card. He was
      distinctly ungrateful; in fact, he remarked that he had been born in this
      very house, but would not trust himself to find his way upstairs with my
      plan as a guide. He also said the American vocabulary was vastly amusing,
      so picturesque, unstudied, and fresh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was nice, surely,&rdquo; I interpolated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know perfectly well that it was an insult.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Francesca is very like that young man,&rdquo; laughed Salemina, &ldquo;who, whenever
      he engaged in controversy, seemed to take off his flesh and sit in his
      nerves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not supersensitive,&rdquo; replied Francesca, &ldquo;but when one&rsquo;s vocabulary is
      called picturesque by a Britisher, one always knows he is thinking of
      cowboys and broncos. However, I shifted the weight into the other scale by
      answering &lsquo;Thank you. And your phraseology is just as unusual to us.&rsquo; 
      &lsquo;Indeed?&rsquo; he said with some surprise. &lsquo;I supposed our method of expression
      very sedate and uneventful.&rsquo; &lsquo;Not at all,&rsquo; I returned, &lsquo;when you say, as
      you did a moment ago, that you never eat potato to your fish.&rsquo; &lsquo;But I do
      not,&rsquo; he urged obtusely. &lsquo;Very likely,&rsquo; I argued, &lsquo;but the fact is not of
      so much importance as the preposition. Now I eat potato WITH my fish.&rsquo; 
      &lsquo;You make a mistake,&rsquo; he said, and we both laughed in spite of ourselves,
      while he murmured, &lsquo;eating potato WITH fish&mdash;how extraordinary.&rsquo; 
      Well, the bridge man may not add perceptibly to the gaiety of the nations,
      but he is better than the Reverend Ronald. I forgot to say that when I
      chanced to be speaking of doughnuts, that &lsquo;unconquer&rsquo;d Scot&rsquo; asked me if a
      doughnut resembled a peanut? Can you conceive such ignorance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you were not only aggressively American, but painfully
      provincial,&rdquo; said Salemina, with some warmth. &ldquo;Why in the world should you
      drag doughnuts into a dinner-table conversation in Edinburgh? Why not
      select topics of universal interest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like the Currie Brig or the shade of Montrose,&rdquo; I murmured slyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To one who has ever eaten a doughnut, the subject is of transcendent
      interest; and as for one who has not&mdash;well, he should be made to feel
      his limitations,&rdquo; replied Francesca, with a yawn. &ldquo;Come, let us forget our
      troubles in sleep; it is after midnight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      About half an hour later she came to my bedside, her dark hair hanging
      over her white gown, her eyes still bright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Penelope,&rdquo; she said softly, &ldquo;I did not dare tell Salemina, and I should
      not confess it to you save that I am afraid Lady Baird will complain of
      me; but I was dreadfully rude to the Reverend Ronald! I couldn&rsquo;t help it;
      he roused my worst passions. It all began with his saying he thought
      international marriages presented even more difficulties to the
      imagination than the other kind. I hadn&rsquo;t said anything about marriages
      nor thought anything about marriages of any sort, but I told him INSTANTLY
      I considered that every international marriage involved two national
      suicides. He said that he shouldn&rsquo;t have put it quite so forcibly, but
      that he hadn&rsquo;t given much thought to the subject. I said that I had, and I
      thought we had gone on long enough filling the coffers of the British
      nobility with American gold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;FRANCES!&rdquo; I interrupted. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me that you made that vulgar, cheap
      newspaper assertion!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did,&rdquo; she replied stoutly, &ldquo;and at the moment I only wished I could
      make it stronger. If there had been anything cheaper or more vulgar, I
      should have said it, but of course there isn&rsquo;t. Then he remarked that the
      British nobility merited and needed all the support it could get in these
      hard times, and asked if we had not cherished some intention in the
      States, lately, of bestowing it in greenbacks instead of gold! I threw all
      manners to the winds after that and told him that there were no husbands
      in the world like American men, and that foreigners never seemed to have
      any proper consideration for women. Now, were my remarks any worse than
      his, after all, and what shall I do about it anyway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should go to bed first,&rdquo; I murmured sleepily; &ldquo;and if you ever have
      an opportunity to make amends, which I doubt, you should devote yourself
      to showing the Reverend Ronald the breadth of your own horizon instead of
      trying so hard to broaden his. As you are extremely pretty, you may
      possibly succeed; man is human, and I dare say in a month you will be
      advising him to love somebody more worthy than yourself. (He could easily
      do it!) Now don&rsquo;t kiss me again, for I am displeased with you; I hate
      international bickering!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; agreed Francesca virtuously, as she plaited her hair, &ldquo;and
      there is no spectacle so abhorrent to every sense as a narrow-minded man
      who cannot see anything outside of his own country. But he is awfully
      good-looking,&mdash;I will say that for him: and if you don&rsquo;t explain me
      to Lady Baird, I will write to Mr. Beresford about the earl. There was no
      bickering there; it was looking at you two that made us think of
      international marriages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must have suggested to you that speech about filling the coffers of
      the British nobility,&rdquo; I replied sarcastically, &ldquo;inasmuch as the earl has
      twenty thousand pounds a year, probably, and I could barely buy two gold
      hairpins to pin on the coronet. There, do go away and leave me in peace!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night again, then,&rdquo; she said, as she rose reluctantly from the foot
      of the bed. &ldquo;I doubt if I can sleep for thinking what a pity it is that
      such an egotistic, bumptious, pugnacious, prejudiced, insular, bigoted
      person should be so handsome! And who wants to marry him any way, that he
      should be so distressed about international alliances? One would think
      that all female America was sighing to lead him to the altar!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      Chapter VIII. &lsquo;What made th&rsquo; Assembly shine?&rsquo; 
    </h2>
    <p>
      Two or three days ago we noted an unusual though subdued air of excitement
      at 22 Breadalbane Terrace, where for a week we had been the sole lodgers.
      Mrs. Menzies, whom we call Mingess, has returned to Kilconquhar, which she
      calls Kinyuchar; Miss Cockburn-Sinclair has purchased her wedding outfit
      and gone back to Inverness, where she will be greeted as Coburn-Sinkler;
      the Hepburn-Sciennes will be leaving to-morrow, just as we have learned to
      pronounce their names; and the sound of the scrubbing-brush is heard in
      the land. In corners where all was clean and spotless before, Mrs.
      M&rsquo;Collop is digging with the broom, and the maiden Boots is following her
      with a damp cloth. The stair carpets are hanging on lines in the back
      garden, and Susanna, with her cap rakishly on one side, is always to be
      seen polishing the stair-rods. Whenever we traverse the halls we are
      obliged to leap over pails of suds, and Miss Diggity-Dalgety has given us
      two dinners which bore a curious resemblance to washing-day repasts in
      suburban America.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it spring house-cleaning?&rdquo; I ask Mistress M&rsquo;Collop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Na, na,&rdquo; she replies hurriedly; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the meenisters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the 19th of May we are a maiden castle no longer. Black coats and hats
      ring at the bell, and pass in and out of the different apartments. The
      hall table is sprinkled with letters, visiting-cards, and programmes which
      seem to have had the alphabet shaken out upon them, for they bear the
      names of professors, doctors, reverends, and very reverends, and fairly
      bristle with A.M.&lsquo;s, M.A.&lsquo;s, A.B.&lsquo;s, D.D.&lsquo;s, and LL.D.&lsquo;s. The voice of
      family prayer is lifted up from the dining-room floor, and paraphrases and
      hymns float down the stairs from above. Their Graces the Lord High
      Commissioner and the Marchioness of Heatherdale will arrive to-day at
      Holyrood Palace, there to reside during the sittings of the General
      Assembly of the Church of Scotland, and to-morrow the Royal Standard will
      be hoisted at Edinburgh Castle from reveille to retreat. His Grace will
      hold a levee at eleven. Directly His Grace leaves the palace after the
      levee, the guard of honour will proceed by the Canongate to receive him on
      his arrival at St. Giles&rsquo; Church, and will then proceed to Assembly Hall
      to receive him on his arrival there. The Sixth Inniskilling Dragoons and
      the First Battalion Royal Scots will be in attendance, and there will be
      Unicorns, Carricks, pursuivants, heralds, mace-bearers, ushers, and pages,
      together with the Purse-bearer, and the Lyon King-of-Arms, and the
      national anthem, and the royal salute; for the palace has awakened and is
      &lsquo;mimicking its past.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Should the weather be wet, the troops will be cloaked at the discretion
      of the commanding officer.&rsquo; They print this instruction as a matter of
      form, and of course every man has his macintosh ready. The only hope lies
      in the fact that this is a national function, and &lsquo;Queen&rsquo;s weather&rsquo; is a
      possibility. The one personage for whom the Scottish climate will
      occasionally relax is Her Majesty Queen Victoria, who for sixty years has
      exerted a benign influence on British skies and at least secured sunshine
      on great parade days. Such women are all too few!
    </p>
    <p>
      In this wise enters His Grace the Lord High Commissioner to open the
      General Assembly of the Church of Scotland; and on the same day there
      arrives by the railway (but travelling first class) the Moderator of the
      Church of Scotland Free, to convene its separate supreme Courts in
      Edinburgh. He will have no Union Jacks, Royal Standards, Dragoons, bands,
      or pipers; he will bear his own purse and stay at an hotel; but when the
      final procession of all comes, he will probably march beside His Grace the
      Lord High Commissioner, and they will talk together, not of dead-and-gone
      kingdoms, but of the one at hand, where there are no more divisions in the
      ranks, and where all the soldiers are simply &lsquo;king&rsquo;s men,&rsquo; marching to
      victory under the inspiration of a common watchword.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a matter of regret to us that the U.P.&lsquo;s, the third branch of
      Scottish Presbyterianism, could not be holding an Assembly during this
      same week, so that we might the more easily decide in which flock we
      really belong. 22 Breadalbane Terrace now represents all shades of
      religious opinion within the bounds of Presbyterianism. We have an Elder,
      a Professor of Biblical Criticism, a Majesty&rsquo;s Chaplain, and even an
      ex-Moderator under our roof, and they are equally divided between the Free
      and the Established bodies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. M&rsquo;Collop herself is a pillar of the Free Kirk, but she has no
      prejudice in lodgers, and says so long as she &lsquo;mak&rsquo;s her rent she doesna
      care aboot their releegious principles.&rsquo; Miss Diggity-Dalgety is the sole
      representative of United Presbyterianism in the household, and she is
      somewhat gloomy in Assembly time. To belong to a dissenting body, and yet
      to cook early and late for the purpose of fattening one&rsquo;s religious
      rivals, is doubtless trying to the temper; and then she asserts that
      &lsquo;meenisters are aye tume [empty].&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must put away your Scottish ballads and histories now, Salemina, and
      keep your Concordance and your umbrella constantly at hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This I said as we stood on George IV. Bridge and saw the ministers
      glooming down from the Mound in a dense Assembly fog. As the presence of
      any considerable number of priests on an ocean steamer is supposed to
      bring rough weather, so the addition of a few hundred parsons to the
      population of Edinburgh is believed to induce rain,&mdash;or perhaps I
      should say, more rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, when one is in perfect bodily health one can more readily
      resist the infection of disease. Similarly if Scottish skies were not
      ready and longing to pour out rain, were not ignobly weak in holding it
      back, they would not be so susceptible to the depressing influences of
      visiting ministers. This is Francesca&rsquo;s theory as stated to the Reverend
      Ronald, who was holding an umbrella over her ungrateful head at the time;
      and she went on to boast of a convention she once attended in California,
      where twenty-six thousand Christian Endeavourers were unable to dim the
      American sunshine, though they stayed ten days.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our first duty, both to ourselves and to the community,&rdquo; I continued to
      Salemina, &ldquo;is to learn how there can be three distinct kinds of proper
      Presbyterianism. Perhaps it would be a graceful act on our part if we
      should each espouse a different kind; then there would be no feeling among
      our Edinburgh friends. And again what is this &lsquo;union&rsquo; of which we hear
      murmurs? Is it religious or political? Is it an echo of the 1707 Union you
      explained to us last week, or is it a new one? What is Disestablishment?
      What is Disruption? Are they the same thing? What is the Sustentation
      Fund? What was the Non-Intrusion party? What was the Dundas Despotism?
      What is the argument at present going on about taking the Shorter
      Catechism out of the schools? What is the Shorter Catechism, any way,&mdash;or
      at least what have they left out of the Longer Catechism to make it
      shorter,&mdash;and is the length of the Catechism one of the points of
      difference? then when we have looked up Chalmers and Candlish, we can ask
      the ex-Moderator and the Professor of Biblical Criticism to tea;
      separately, of course, lest there should be ecclesiastical quarrels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Salemina and Francesca both incline to the Established church, I lean
      instinctively toward the Free; but that does not mean that we have any
      knowledge of the differences that separate them. Salemina is a
      conservative in all things; she loves law, order, historic associations,
      old customs; and so when there is a regularly established national church,&mdash;or,
      for that matter, a regularly established anything, she gravitates to it by
      the law of her being. Francesca&rsquo;s religious convictions, when she is away
      from her own minister and native land, are inclined to be flexible. The
      church that enters Edinburgh with a marquis and a marchioness representing
      the Crown, the church that opens its Assembly with splendid processions
      and dignified pageants, the church that dispenses generous hospitality
      from Holyrood Palace,&mdash;above all, the church that escorts its Lord
      High Commissioner from place to place with bands and pipers,&mdash;that is
      the church to which she pledges her constant presence and enthusiastic
      support.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for me, I believe I am a born protestant, or &lsquo;come-outer,&rsquo; as they used
      to call dissenters in the early days of New England. I have not yet had
      time to study the question, but as I lack all knowledge of the other two
      branches of Presbyterianism, I am enabled to say unhesitatingly that I
      belong to the Free Kirk. To begin with, the very word &lsquo;free&rsquo; has a
      fascination for the citizen of a republic; and then my theological
      training was begun this morning by a gifted young minister of Edinburgh
      whom we call the Friar, because the first time we saw him in his gown and
      bands (the little spot of sheer whiteness beneath the chin, that lends
      such added spirituality to a spiritual face) we fancied that he looked
      like some pale brother of the Church in the olden time. His pallor, in a
      land of rosy redness and milky whiteness; his smooth, fair hair, which in
      the light from the stained-glass window above the pulpit looked reddish
      gold; the Southern heat of passionate conviction that coloured his slow
      Northern speech; the remoteness of his personality; the weariness of his
      deep-set eyes, that bespoke such fastings and vigils as he probably never
      practised,&mdash;all this led to our choice of the name.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we walked toward St. Andrew&rsquo;s Church and Tanfield Hall, where he
      insisted on taking me to get the &lsquo;proper historical background,&rsquo; he told
      me about the great Disruption movement. He was extremely eloquent,&mdash;so
      eloquent that the image of Willie Beresford tottered continually on its
      throne, and I found not the slightest difficulty in giving an unswerving
      allegiance to the principles presented by such an orator.
    </p>
    <p>
      We went first to St. Andrew&rsquo;s, where the General Assembly met in 1843, and
      where the famous exodus of the Free Protesting Church took place,&mdash;one
      of the most important events in the modern history of the United Kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The movement was promoted by the great Dr. Chalmers and his party, mainly
      to abolish the patronage of livings, then in the hands of certain heritors
      or patrons, who might appoint any minister they wished, without consulting
      the congregation. Needless to say, as a free-born American citizen, and
      never having had a heritor in the family, my blood easily boiled at the
      recital of such tyranny. In 1834 the Church had passed a law of its own,
      it seems, ordaining that no presentee to a parish should be admitted, if
      opposed by the majority of the male communicants. That would have been
      well enough could the State have been made to agree, though I should have
      gone further, personally, and allowed the female communicants to have some
      voice in the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Friar took me into a particularly chilly historic corner, and, leaning
      against a damp stone pillar, painted the scene in St. Andrew&rsquo;s when the
      Assembly met in the presence of a great body of spectators, while a vast
      throng gathered without, breathlessly awaiting the result. No one believed
      that any large number of ministers would relinquish livings and stipends
      and cast their bread upon the waters for what many thought a &lsquo;fantastic
      principle.&rsquo; Yet when the Moderator left his place, after reading a formal
      protest signed by one hundred and twenty ministers and seventy-two elders,
      he was followed first by Dr. Chalmers, and then by four hundred and
      seventy men, who marched in a body to Tanfield Hall, where they formed
      themselves into the General Assembly of the Free Church of Scotland. When
      Lord Jeffrey was told of it an hour later, he exclaimed, &lsquo;Thank God for
      Scotland! there is not another country on earth where such a deed could be
      done!&rsquo; And the Friar reminded me proudly of Macaulay&rsquo;s saying that the
      Scots had made sacrifices for the sake of religious opinion for which
      there was no parallel in the annals of England. On the next Sunday after
      these remarkable scenes in Edinburgh there were heart-breaking farewells,
      so the Friar said, in many village parishes, when the minister, in
      dismissing his congregation, told them that he had ceased to belong to the
      Established Church and would neither preach nor pray in that pulpit again;
      that he had joined the Free Protesting Church of Scotland, and, God
      willing, would speak the next Sabbath morning at the manse door to as many
      as cared to follow him. &ldquo;What affecting leave-takings there must have
      been!&rdquo; the Friar exclaimed. &ldquo;When my grandfather left his church that May
      morning, only fifteen members remained behind, and he could hear the more
      courageous say to the timid ones, &lsquo;Tak&rsquo; your Bible and come awa&rsquo;, mon!&rsquo; 
      Was not all this a splendid testimony to the power of principle and the
      sacred demands of conscience?&rdquo; I said &ldquo;Yea&rdquo; most heartily, for the spirit
      of Jenny Geddes stirred within me that morning, and under the spell of the
      Friar&rsquo;s kindling eye and eloquent voice I positively gloried in the
      valiant achievements of the Free Church. It would always be easier for a
      woman to say, &ldquo;Yea&rdquo; than &ldquo;Nay&rdquo; to the Friar. When he left me in
      Breadalbane Terrace I was at heart a member of his congregation in good
      (and irregular) standing, ready to teach in his Sunday-school, sing in his
      choir, visit his aged and sick poor, and especially to stand between him
      and a too admiring feminine constituency.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I entered the drawing-room, I found that Salemina had just enjoyed an
      hour&rsquo;s conversation with the ex-Moderator of the opposite church wing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear,&rdquo; she sighed, &ldquo;you have missed such a treat! You have no
      conception of these Scottish ministers of the Establishment,&mdash;such
      culture, such courtliness of manner, such scholarship, such spirituality,
      such wise benignity of opinion! I asked the doctor to explain the
      Disruption movement to me, and he was most interesting and lucid, and most
      affecting, too, when he described the misunderstandings and misconceptions
      that the Church suffered in those terrible days of 1843, when its very
      life-blood, as well as its integrity and unity, were threatened by the
      foes in its own household; when breaches of faith and trust occurred on
      all sides, and dissents and disloyalties shook it to its very foundation!
      You see, Penelope, I have never fully understood the disagreements about
      heritors and livings and state control before, but here is the whole
      matter in a nut-sh&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Salemina,&rdquo; I interposed, with dignity, &ldquo;you will pardon me, I am
      sure, when I tell you that any discussion on this point would be intensely
      painful to me, as I now belong to the Free Kirk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where have you been this morning?&rdquo; she asked, with a piercing glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To St. Andrew&rsquo;s and Tanfield Hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With the Friar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see! Happy the missionary to whom you incline your ear, FIRST!&rdquo;&mdash;which
      I thought rather inconsistent of Salemina, as she had been converted by
      precisely the same methods and in precisely the same length of time as had
      I, the only difference being in the ages of our respective missionaries,
      one being about five-and-thirty, and other five-and-sixty. Even this is to
      my credit after all, for if one can be persuaded so quickly and fully by a
      young and comparatively inexperienced man, it shows that one must be
      extremely susceptible to spiritual influences or&mdash;something.

    <h2>
      Chapter IX. Omnia presbyteria est divisa in partes tres.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Religion in Edinburgh is a theory, a convention, a fashion (both humble
      and aristocratic), a sensation, an intellectual conviction, an emotion, a
      dissipation, a sweet habit of the blood; in fact, it is, it seems to me,
      every sort of thing it can be to the human spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we had finished our church toilettes, and came into the drawing-room,
      on the first Sunday morning, I remember that we found Francesca at the
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a battle, murder, or sudden death going on in the square below,&rdquo;
       she said. &ldquo;I am going to ask Susanna to ask Mrs. M&rsquo;Collop what it means.
      Never have I seen such a crowd moving peacefully, with no excitement or
      confusion, in one direction. Where can the people be going? Do you suppose
      it is a fire? Why, I believe... it cannot be possible... yes, they
      certainly are disappearing in that big church on the corner; and millions,
      simply millions and trillions, are coming in the other direction,&mdash;toward
      St. Knox&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Impressive as was this morning church-going, a still greater surprise
      awaited us at seven o&rsquo;clock in the evening, when the crowd blocked the
      streets on two sides of a church near Breadalbane Terrace; and though it
      was quite ten minutes before service when we entered, Salemina and I only
      secured the last two seats in the aisle, and Francesca was obliged to sit
      on the steps of the pulpit or seek a sermon elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      It amused me greatly to see Francesca sitting on pulpit steps, her Paris
      gown and smart toque in close juxtaposition to the rusty bonnet and
      bombazine dress of a respectable elderly tradeswoman. The church officer
      entered first, bearing the great Bible and hymn-book, which he reverently
      placed on the pulpit cushions; and close behind him, to our entire
      astonishment, came the Reverend Ronald Macdonald, evidently exchanging
      with the regular minister of the parish, whom we had come especially to
      hear. I pitied Francesca&rsquo;s confusion and embarrassment, but I was too far
      from her to offer an exchange of seats, and through the long service she
      sat there at the feet of her foe, so near that she could have touched the
      hem of his gown as he knelt devoutly for his first silent prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps she was thinking of her last interview with him, when she
      descanted at length on that superfluity of naughtiness and Biblical
      pedantry which, she asserted, made Scottish ministers preach from
      out-of-the-way texts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never been able to find my place in the Bible since I arrived,&rdquo;
       she complained to Salemina, when she was quite sure that Mr. Macdonald was
      listening to her; and this he generally was, in my opinion, no matter who
      chanced to be talking. &ldquo;What with their skipping and hopping about from
      Haggai to Philemon, Habakkuk to Jude, and Micah to Titus, in their
      readings, and then settling on seventh Nahum, sixth Zephaniah, or second
      Calathumpians for the sermon, I do nothing but search the Scriptures in
      the Edinburgh churches,&mdash;search, search, search, until some Christian
      by my side or in the pew behind me notices my hapless plight, and hands me
      a Bible opened at the text. Last Sunday it was Obadiah first, fifteenth,
      &lsquo;For the day of the Lord is near upon all the heathen.&rsquo; It chanced to be a
      returned missionary who was preaching on that occasion; but the Bible is
      full of heathen, and why need he have chosen a text from Obadiah, poor
      little Obadiah one page long, slipped in between Amos and Jonah, where
      nobody but an elder could find him?&rdquo; If Francesca had not seen with wicked
      delight the Reverend Ronald&rsquo;s expression of anxiety, she would never have
      spoken of second Calathumpians; but of course he has no means of knowing
      how unlike herself she is when in his company.
    </p>
    <p>
      To go back to our first Sunday worship in Edinburgh. The church officer
      closed the door of the pulpit on the Reverend Ronald, and I thought I
      heard the clicking of a lock; at all events, he returned at the close of
      the services to liberate him and escort him back to the vestry; for the
      entrances and exits of this beadle, or &lsquo;minister&rsquo;s man,&rsquo; as the church
      officer is called in the country districts, form an impressive part of the
      ceremonies. If he did lock the minister into the pulpit, it is probably
      only another national custom, like the occasional locking in of the
      passengers in a railway train, and may be positively necessary in the case
      of such magnetic and popular preachers as Mr. Macdonald, or the Friar.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have never seen such attention, such concentration, as in these great
      congregations of the Edinburgh churches. As nearly as I can judge, it is
      intellectual rather than emotional; but it is not a tribute paid to
      eloquence alone, it is habitual and universal, and is yielded loyally to
      insufferable dulness when occasion demands.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the text is announced, there is an indescribable rhythmic movement
      forward, followed by a concerted rustle of Bible leaves; not the rustle of
      a few Bibles in a few pious pews, but the rustle of all of them in all the
      pews,&mdash;and there are more Bibles in an Edinburgh Presbyterian church
      than one ever sees anywhere else, unless it be in the warehouses of the
      Bible Societies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The text is read twice clearly, and another rhythmic movement follows when
      the books are replaced on the shelves. Then there is a delightful settling
      back of the entire congregation, a snuggling comfortably into corners and
      a fitting of shoulders to the pews.&mdash;not to sleep, however; an older
      generation may have done that under the strain of a two-hour &lsquo;wearifu&rsquo; 
      dreich&rsquo; sermon, but these church-goers are not to be caught napping. They
      wear, on the contrary, a keen, expectant, critical look, which must be
      inexpressibly encouraging to the minister, if he has anything to say. If
      he has not (and this is a possibility in Edinburgh, as it is everywhere
      else), then I am sure it is wisdom for the beadle to lock him in, lest he
      flee when he meets those searching eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Edinburgh sermon, though doubtless softened in outline in these later
      years, is still a more carefully built discourse than one ordinarily hears
      out of Scotland, being constructed on conventional lines of doctrine,
      exposition, logical inference, and practical application. Though modern
      preachers do not announce the division of their subject into heads and
      sub-heads, firstlies and secondlies and finallies, my brethren, there
      seems to be the old framework underneath the sermon, and every one
      recognises it as moving silently below the surface; at least, I always
      fancy that as the minister finishes one point and attacks another the
      younger folk fix their eagle eyes on him afresh, and the whole
      congregation sits up straighter and listens more intently, as if making
      mental notes. They do not listen so much as if they were enthralled,
      though they often are, and have good reason to be, but as if they were to
      pass an examination on the subject afterwards; and I have no doubt that
      this is the fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prayers are many, and are divided, apparently, like those of the
      liturgies, into petitions, confessions, and aspirations; not forgetting
      the all-embracing one with which we are perfectly familiar in our native
      land, in which the preacher commends to the Fatherly care every animate
      and inanimate thing not mentioned specifically in the foregoing
      supplications. It was in the middle of this compendious petition, &lsquo;the
      lang prayer,&rsquo; that rheumatic old Scottish dames used to make a practice of
      &lsquo;cheengin&rsquo; the fit,&rsquo; as they stood devoutly through it. &ldquo;When the
      meenister comes to the &lsquo;ingetherin&rsquo; o&rsquo; the Gentiles,&rsquo; I ken weel it&rsquo;s time
      to cheenge legs, for then the prayer is jist half dune,&rdquo; said a good
      sermon-taster of Fife.
    </p>
    <p>
      The organ is finding its way rapidly into the Scottish kirks (how can the
      shade of John Knox endure a &lsquo;kist o&rsquo; whistles&rsquo; in good St. Giles&rsquo;?), but
      it is not used yet in some of those we attend most frequently. There is a
      certain quaint solemnity, a beautiful austerity, in the unaccompanied
      singing of hymns that touches me profoundly. I am often carried very high
      on the waves of splendid church music, when the organ&rsquo;s thunder rolls
      &lsquo;through vaulted aisles&rsquo; and the angelic voices of a trained choir chant
      the aspirations of my soul for me; and when an Edinburgh congregation
      stands, and the precentor leads in that noble paraphrase,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;God of our fathers, be the God
   Of their succeeding race,&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      there is a certain ascetic fervour in it that seems to me the perfection
      of worship. It may be that my Puritan ancestors are mainly responsible for
      this feeling, or perhaps my recently adopted Jenny Geddes is a factor in
      it; of course, if she were in the habit of flinging fauldstules at Deans,
      she was probably the friend of truth and the foe of beauty, so far as it
      was in her power to separate them.

      There is no music during the offertory in these churches, and this, too,
      pleases my sense of the fitness of things. It cannot soften the woe of the
      people who are disinclined to the giving away of money, and the cheerful
      givers need no encouragement. For my part, I like to sit, quite
      undistracted by soprano solos, and listen to the refined tinkle of the
      sixpences and shillings, and the vulgar chink of the pennies and
      ha&rsquo;pennies, in the contribution-boxes. Country ministers, I am told,
      develop such an acute sense of hearing that they can estimate the amount
      of the collection before it is counted. There is often a huge pewter plate
      just within the church door, in which the offerings are placed as the
      worshippers enter or leave; and one always notes the preponderance of
      silver at the morning, and of copper at the evening services. It is
      perhaps needless to say that before Francesca had been in Edinburgh a
      fortnight she asked Mr. Macdonald if it were true that the Scots continued
      coining the farthing for years and years, merely to have a piece of money
      serviceable for church offerings!
    </p>
    <p>
      As to social differences in the congregations we are somewhat at sea. We
      tried to arrive at a conclusion by the hats and bonnets, than which there
      is usually no more infallible test. On our first Sunday we attended the
      Free Kirk in the morning, and the Established in the evening. The bonnets
      of the Free Kirk were so much the more elegant that we said to one
      another, &ldquo;This is evidently the church of society, though the adjective
      &lsquo;Free&rsquo; should by rights attract the masses.&rdquo; On the second Sunday we
      reversed the order of things, and found the Established bonnets much finer
      than the Free bonnets, which was a source of mystification to us, until we
      discovered that it was a question of morning or evening service, not of
      the form of Presbyterianism. We think, on the whole, that, taking town and
      country congregations together, millinery has not flourished under
      Presbyterianism,&mdash;it seems to thrive better in the Romish atmosphere
      of France; but the Disruption at least, has had nothing to answer for in
      the matter, as it appears simply to have parted the bonnets of Scotland in
      twain, as Moses divided the Red Sea, and left good and evil on both sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can never forget our first military service at St. Giles&rsquo;. We left
      Breadalbane Terrace before nine in the morning and walked along the
      beautiful curve of street that sweeps around the base of the Castle Rock,&mdash;walked
      on through the poverty and squalor of the High Street, keeping in view the
      beautiful lantern tower as a guiding-star, till we heard
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;The murmur of the city crowd;
   And, from his steeple, jingling loud,
     St. Giles&rsquo;s mingling din.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      We joined the throng outside the venerable church, and awaited the
      approach of the soldiers from the Castle parade-ground; for it is from
      there they march in detachments to the church of their choice. A religion
      they must have, and if, when called up and questioned about it, they have
      forgotten to provide themselves, or have no preference as to form of
      worship, they are assigned to one by the person in authority. When the
      regiments are assembled on the parade-ground of a Sunday morning, the
      first command is, &lsquo;Church of Scotland, right about face, quick march!&rsquo;&mdash;the
      bodies of men belonging to other denominations standing fast until their
      turn comes to move. It is said that a new officer once gave the command,
      &lsquo;Church of Scotland, right about face, quick march! Fancy releegions, stay
      where ye are!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as we were being told this story by an attendant squire, there was a
      burst of scarlet and a blare of music, and down Castlehill and the
      Lawnmarket into Parliament Square marched hundreds of redcoats, the
      Highland pipers (otherwise the Olympian gods) swinging in front, leaving
      the American female heart prostrate beneath their victorious tread. The
      strains of music that in the distance sounded so martial and triumphant we
      recognised in a moment as &lsquo;Abide with me,&rsquo; and never did the fine old tune
      seem more majestic than when it marked a measure for the steady tramp,
      tramp, tramp, of those soldierly feet. As &lsquo;The March of the Cameron Men,&rsquo; 
      piped from the green steeps of Castlehill, had aroused in us thoughts of
      splendid victories on the battlefield, so did this simple hymn awake the
      spirit of the church militant; a no less stern but more spiritual
      soldiership, in which &lsquo;the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them
      that make peace.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As I fell asleep on that first Sunday night in Edinburgh, after the
      somewhat unusual experience of three church services in a single day,
      three separate notes of memory floated in and out of the fabric of my
      dreams; the sound of the soldiers&rsquo; feet marching into old St. Giles&rsquo; to
      the strains of &lsquo;Abide with me&rsquo;; the voice of the Reverend Ronald ringing
      out with manly insistence: &lsquo;It is aspiration that counts, not realisation;
      pursuit, not achievement; quest, not conquest!&rsquo;&mdash;and the closing
      phrases of the Friar&rsquo;s prayer; &lsquo;When Christ has forgiven us, help us to
      forgive ourselves! Help us to forgive ourselves so fully that we can even
      forget ourselves, remembering only Him! And so let His kingdom come; we
      ask it for the King&rsquo;s sake, Amen.&rsquo;

    <h2>
      Chapter X. Mrs. M&rsquo;Collop as a sermon-taster.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Even at this time of Assemblies, when the atmosphere is almost exclusively
      clerical and ecclesiastical, the two great church armies represented here
      certainly conceal from the casual observer all rivalries and jealousies,
      if indeed they cherish any. As for the two dissenting bodies, the Church
      of the Disruption and the Church of the Secession have been keeping
      company, so to speak, for some years, with a distant eye to an eventual
      union. In the light of all this pleasant toleration, it seems difficult to
      realise that earlier Edinburgh, where, we learned from old parochial
      records of 1605, Margaret Sinclair was cited by the Session of the Kirk
      for being at the &lsquo;Burne&rsquo; for water on the Sabbath; that Janet Merling was
      ordered to make public repentance for concealing a bairn unbaptized in her
      house for the space of twenty weeks and calling said bairn Janet; that Pat
      Richardson had to crave mercy for being found in his boat in time of
      afternoon service; and that Janet Walker, accused of having visitors in
      her house in sermon-time, had to confess her offence and on her knees
      crave mercy of God AND the Kirk Session (which no doubt was much worse)
      under penalty of a hundred pounds Scots. Possibly there are people yet who
      would prefer to pay a hundred pounds rather than hear a sermon, but they
      are few.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in the early seventeen hundred and thirties when Allan Ramsay, &lsquo;in
      fear and trembling of legal and clerical censure,&rsquo; lent out the plays of
      Congreve and Farquhar from his famous High Street library. In 1756 it was,
      that the Presbytery of Edinburgh suspended all clergymen who had witnessed
      the representation of Douglas, that virtuous tragedy written, to the
      dismay of all Scotland, by a minister of the Kirk. That the world, even
      the theological world, moves with tolerable rapidity when once set in
      motion, is evinced by the fact that on Mrs. Siddons&rsquo; second engagement in
      Edinburgh, in the summer of 1785, vast crowds gathered about the doors of
      the theatre, not at night alone, but in the day, to secure places. It
      became necessary to admit them first at three in the afternoon and then at
      noon, and eventually &lsquo;the General Assembly of the Church then in session
      was compelled to arrange its meetings with reference to the appearance of
      the great actress.&rsquo; How one would have enjoyed hearing that Scotsman say,
      after one of her most splendid flights of tragic passion, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s no bad!&rsquo; 
      We have read of her dismay at this ludicrous parsimony of praise, but her
      self-respect must have been restored when the Edinburgh ladies fainted by
      dozens during her impersonation of Isabella in The Fatal Marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since Scottish hospitality is well-nigh inexhaustible, it is not strange
      that from the moment Edinburgh streets began to be crowded with ministers,
      our drawing-room table began to bear shoals of engraved invitations of
      every conceivable sort, all equally unfamiliar to our American eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Purse-Bearer is commanded by the Lord High Commissioner and the
      Marchioness of Heatherdale to invite Miss Hamilton to a Garden Party at
      the Palace of Holyrood House, on the 27th of May. WEATHER PERMITTING.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The General Assembly of the Free Church of Scotland admits Miss Hamilton
      to any gallery on any day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Marchioness of Heatherdale is At Home on the 26th of May from a
      quarter-past nine in the evening. Palace of Holyrood House.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Moderator of the General Assembly of the Free Church of Scotland is
      At Home in the Library of the New College on Saturday, the 22nd of May,
      from eight to ten in the evening.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Moderator asks the pleasure of Miss Hamilton&rsquo;s presence at a
      Breakfast to be given on the morning of the 25th May at Dunedin Hotel.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      We determined to go to all these functions impartially, tracking thus the
      Presbyterian lion to his very lair, and observing his home as well as his
      company manners. In everything that related to the distinctively religious
      side of the proceedings we sought advice from Mrs. M&rsquo;Collop, while we went
      to Lady Baird for definite information on secular matters. We also found
      an unexpected ally in the person of our own ex-Moderator&rsquo;s niece, Miss
      Jean Dalziel (Deeyell). She has been educated in Paris, but she must
      always have been a delightfully breezy person, quite too irrepressible to
      be affected by Scottish haar or theology. &ldquo;Go to the Assemblies, by all
      means,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and be sure and get places for the heresy case. These
      are no longer what they once were,&mdash;we are getting lamentably weak
      and gelatinous in our beliefs,&mdash;but there is an unusually nice one
      this year; the heretic is very young and handsome, and quite wicked, as
      ministers go. Don&rsquo;t fail to be presented at the Marchioness&rsquo;s court at
      Holyrood, for it is a capital preparation for the ordeal of Her Majesty
      and Buckingham Palace. &lsquo;Nothing fit to wear&rsquo;? You have never seen the
      people who go or you wouldn&rsquo;t say that! I even advise you to attend one of
      the breakfasts; it can&rsquo;t do you any serious or permanent injury so long as
      you eat something before you go. Oh no, it doesn&rsquo;t matter,&mdash;whichever
      one you choose, you will cheerfully omit the other; for I avow, as a
      Scottish spinster, and the niece of an ex-Moderator, that to a stranger
      and a foreigner the breakfasts are worse than Arctic explorations. If you
      do not chance to be at the table of honour&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The gifted Miss Hamilton is always at the table of honour; unless she is
      placed there she refuses to eat, and then the universe rocks to its
      centre,&rdquo; interpolated Francesca impertinently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; continued Miss Dalziel, &ldquo;you will often sit beside a
      minister or a minister&rsquo;s wife, who will make you scorn the sordid
      appetites of flesh, but if you do not, then eat as little as may be, and
      flee up the Mound to whichever Assembly is the Mecca of your soul!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My niece&rsquo;s tongue is an unruly member,&rdquo; said the ex-Moderator, who was
      present at this diatribe, &ldquo;and the principal mistakes she makes in her
      judgment of these clerical feasts is that she criticises them as
      conventional repasts, whereas they are intended to be informal meetings
      together of people who wish to be better acquainted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hot bacon and eggs would be no harm to friendship,&rdquo; answered Miss
      Dalziel, with an affectionate moue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cold bacon and eggs is better than cold piety,&rdquo; said the ex-Moderator,
      &ldquo;and it may be a good discipline for fastidious young ladies who have been
      spoiled by Parisian breakfasts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is to Mrs. M&rsquo;Collop that we owe our chief insight into technical church
      matters, although we seldom agree with her &lsquo;opeenions&rsquo; after we gain our
      own experience. She never misses hearing one sermon on a Sabbath, and
      oftener she listens to two or three. Neither does she confine herself to
      the ministrations of a single preacher, but roves from one sanctuary to
      another, seeking the bread of life,&mdash;often, however, according to her
      own account, getting a particularly indigestible &lsquo;stane.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She is thus a complete guide to the Edinburgh pulpit, and when she is
      making a bed in the morning she dispenses criticism in so large and
      impartial a manner that it would make the flesh of the &lsquo;meenistry&rsquo; creep
      were it overheard. I used to think Ian Maclaren&rsquo;s sermon-taster a possible
      exaggeration of an existent type, but I now see that she is truth itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll be tryin&rsquo; anither kirk the morn?&rdquo; suggests Mrs. M&rsquo;Collop, spreading
      the clean Sunday sheet over the mattress. &ldquo;Wha did ye hear the Sawbath
      that&rsquo;s bye? Dr. A? Ay, I ken him ower weel; he&rsquo;s been there for fifteen
      years an&rsquo; mair. Ay, he&rsquo;s a gifted mon&mdash;AFF AN&rsquo; ON!&rdquo; with an emphasis
      showing clearly that, in her estimation, the times when he is &lsquo;aff&rsquo; 
      outnumber those when he is &lsquo;on&rsquo;... &ldquo;Ye havena heard auld Dr. B yet?&rdquo; (Here
      she tucks in the upper sheet tidily at the foot.) &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a graund
      strachtforrit mon, is Dr. B, forbye he&rsquo;s growin&rsquo; maist awfu&rsquo; dreich in his
      sermons, though when he&rsquo;s that wearisome a body canna heed him wi&rsquo;oot
      takin&rsquo; peppermints to the kirk, he&rsquo;s nane the less, at seeventy-sax, a
      better mon than the new asseestant. Div ye ken the new asseestant? He&rsquo;s a
      wee-bit, finger-fed mannie, ower sma&rsquo; maist to wear a goon! I canna thole
      him, wi&rsquo; his lang-nebbit words, explainin&rsquo; an&rsquo; expoundin&rsquo; the gude Book as
      if it had jist come oot! The auld doctor&rsquo;s nae kirk-filler, but he gies us
      fu&rsquo; meesure, pressed doun an&rsquo; rinnin&rsquo; ower, nae bit-pickin&rsquo;s like the
      haverin&rsquo; asseestant; it&rsquo;s my opeenion he&rsquo;s no soond, wi&rsquo; his parleyvoos
      an&rsquo; his clishmaclavers!... Mr. C?&rdquo; (Now comes the shaking and
      straightening and smoothing of the first blanket.) &ldquo;Ay, he&rsquo;s weel eneuch!
      I mind aince he prayed for oor Free Assembly, an&rsquo; then he turned roon&rsquo; an&rsquo; 
      prayed for the Estaiblished, maist in the same breath,&mdash;he&rsquo;s a broad,
      leeberal mon is Mr. C!... Mr. D? Ay, I ken him fine; he micht be waur,
      though he&rsquo;s ower fond o&rsquo; the kittle pairts o&rsquo; the Old Testament; but he
      reads his sermon frae the paper, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s an auld sayin&rsquo;, &lsquo;If a meenister
      canna mind [remember] his ain discoorse, nae mair can the congregation be
      expectit to mind it.&rsquo;... Mr. E? He&rsquo;s my ain meenister.&rdquo; (She has a pillow
      in her mouth now, but though she is shaking it as a terrier would a rat,
      and drawing on the linen slip at the same time, she is still intelligible
      between the jerks). &ldquo;Susanna says his sermon is like claith made o&rsquo; soond
      &lsquo;oo [wool] wi&rsquo; a guid twined thread, an&rsquo; wairpit an&rsquo; weftit wi&rsquo; doctrine.
      Susanna kens her Bible weel, but she&rsquo;s never gaed forrit.&rdquo; (To &lsquo;gang
      forrit&rsquo; is to take the communion). &ldquo;Dr. F? I ca&rsquo; him the greetin&rsquo; doctor!
      He&rsquo;s aye dingin&rsquo; the dust oot o&rsquo; the poopit cushions, an&rsquo; greetin&rsquo; ower
      the sins o&rsquo; the human race, an&rsquo; eespecially o&rsquo; his ain congregation. He&rsquo;s
      waur sin his last wife sickened an&rsquo; slippit awa&rsquo;. &lsquo;Twas a chastenin&rsquo; he&rsquo;d
      put up wi&rsquo; twice afore, but he grat nane the less. She was a bonnie bit
      body, was the thurd Mistress F! E&rsquo;nboro could &lsquo;a&rsquo; better spared the
      greetin&rsquo; doctor than her, I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away, according to His good will and
      pleasure,&rdquo; I ventured piously, as Mrs. M&rsquo;Collop beat the bolster and laid
      it in place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ou ay,&rdquo; responded that good woman, as she spread the counterpane over the
      pillows in the way I particularly dislike,&mdash;&ldquo;ou ay, but whiles I
      think it&rsquo;s a peety he couldna be guidit!&rdquo;

      Chapter XI. Holyrood awakens.
    </h2>
    <p>
      We were to make our bow to the Lord High Commissioner and the Marchioness
      of Heatherdale in the evening, and we were in a state of republican
      excitement at 22 Breadalbane Terrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francesca had surprised us by refusing to be presented at this semi-royal
      Scottish court. &ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The Marchioness represents the Queen;
      we may discover, when we arrive, that she has raised the standards of
      admission, and requires us to &lsquo;back out&rsquo; of the throne-room. I don&rsquo;t
      propose to do that without London training. Besides, I detest crowds, and
      I never go to my own President&rsquo;s receptions; and I have a headache,
      anyway, and I don&rsquo;t feel like coping with the Reverend Ronald to-night!&rdquo;
       (Lady Baird was to take us under her wing, and her nephew was to escort
      us, Sir Robert being in Inveraray).
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sally, my dear,&rdquo; I said, as Francesca left the room with a bottle of
      smelling-salts somewhat ostentatiously in evidence, &ldquo;methinks the damsel
      doth protest too much. In other words, she devotes a good deal of time and
      discussion to a gentleman whom she heartily dislikes. As she is under your
      care, I will direct your attention to the following points:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ronald Macdonald is a Scotsman; Francesca disapproves of international
      alliances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a Presbyterian; she is a Swedenborgian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His father was a famous old-school doctor; Francesca is a homoeopathist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is serious; Francesca is gay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, under all the circumstances, their acquaintance will bear
      watching. Two persons so utterly dissimilar, and, so far as superficial
      observation goes, so entirely unsuited to each other, are quite likely to
      drift into marriage unless diverted by watchful philanthropists.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; returned Salemina brusquely. &ldquo;You think because you are under
      the spell of the tender passion yourself that other people are in constant
      danger. Francesca detests him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who told you so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She herself,&rdquo; triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Salemina,&rdquo; I said pityingly, &ldquo;I have always believed you a spinster from
      choice; don&rsquo;t lead me to think that you have never had any experience in
      these matters! The Reverend Ronald has also intimated to me as plainly as
      he dared that he cannot bear the sight of Francesca. What do I gather from
      this statement? The general conclusion that if it be true, it is curious
      that he looks at her incessantly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Francesca would never live in Scotland,&rdquo; remarked Salemina feebly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not unless she were asked, of course,&rdquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would never ask her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not unless he thought he had a chance of an affirmative answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her father would never allow it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her father allows what she permits him to allow. You know that perfectly
      well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall I do about it, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Consult me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall WE do about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let Nature have her own way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in Nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be profane, Salemina, and don&rsquo;t be unromantic, which is worse; but
      if you insist, trust in Providence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would rather trust Francesca&rsquo;s hard heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The hardest hearts melt if sufficient heat be applied. Did I take you to
      Newhaven and read you Christie Johnstone on the beach for nought? Don&rsquo;t
      you remember Charles Reade said that the Scotch are icebergs, with
      volcanoes underneath; thaw the Scotch ice, which is very cold, and you
      shall get to the Scotch fire, warmer than any sun of Italy or Spain. I
      think Mr. Macdonald is a volcano.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish he were extinct,&rdquo; said Salemina petulantly; &ldquo;and I wish you
      wouldn&rsquo;t make me nervous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you had any faculty of premonition, you wouldn&rsquo;t have waited for me to
      make you nervous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some people are singularly omniscient.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Others are singularly deficient&mdash;&rdquo; And at this moment Susanna Crum
      came in to announce Miss Jean Dalziel, who had come to see sights with us.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was our almost daily practice to walk through the Old Town, and we were
      now familiar with every street and close in that densely-crowded quarter.
      Our quest for the sites of ancient landmarks never grew monotonous, and we
      were always reconstructing, in imagination, the Cowgate, the Canongate,
      the Lawnmarket, and the High Street, until we could see Auld Reekie as it
      was in bygone centuries. In those days of continual war with England,
      people crowded their dwellings as near the Castle as possible, so floor
      was piled upon floor, and flat upon flat, families ensconcing themselves
      above other families, the tendency being ever skyward. Those who dwelt on
      top had no desire to spend their strength in carrying down the corkscrew
      stairs matter which would descend by the force of gravity if pitched from
      the window or door; so the wayfarer, especially after dusk, would be
      greeted with cries of &lsquo;Get oot o&rsquo; the gait!&rsquo; or &lsquo;Gardy loo!&rsquo; which was in
      the French &lsquo;Gardez l&rsquo;eau,&rsquo; and which would have been understood in any
      language, I fancy, after a little experience. The streets then were filled
      with the debris flung from a hundred upper windows, while certain
      ground-floor tenants, such as butchers and candlemakers, contributed their
      full share to the fragrant heaps. As for these too seldom used narrow
      turnpike stairs, imagine the dames of fashion tilting their vast hoops and
      silken show-petticoats up and down in them!
    </p>
    <p>
      That swine roamed at will in these Elysian fields is to be presumed, since
      we have this amusing picture of three High Street belles and beauties in
      the Traditions of Edinburgh:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So easy were the manners of the great, fabled to be so stiff and
      decorous,&rsquo; says the author, &lsquo;that Lady Maxwell&rsquo;s daughter Jane, who
      afterward became the Duchess of Gordon, was seen riding a sow up the High
      Street, while her sister Eglantine (afterwards Lady Wallace of Craigie)
      thumped lustily behind with a stick.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      No wonder, in view of all this, that King James VI., when about to bring
      home his &lsquo;darrest spous,&rsquo; Anne of Denmark, wrote to the Provost, &lsquo;For
      God&rsquo;s sake see a&rsquo; things are richt at our hame-coming; a king with a
      new-married wife doesna come hame ilka day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Had it not been for these royal home-comings and visits of distinguished
      foreigners, now and again aided by something still more salutary, an
      occasional outbreak of the plague, the easy-going authorities would never
      have issued any &lsquo;cleaning edicts,&rsquo; and the still easier-going inhabitants
      would never have obeyed them. It was these dark, tortuous wynds and
      closes, nevertheless, that made up the Court End of Old Edinbro&rsquo;; for some
      one writes in 1530, &lsquo;Via vaccarum in qua habitant patricii et senatores
      urbis&rsquo; (The nobility and chief senators of the city dwell in the Cowgate).
      And as for the Canongate, this Saxon gaet or way of the Holy rood canons,
      it still sheltered in 1753 &lsquo;two dukes, sixteen earls, two dowager
      countesses, seven lords, seven lords of session, thirteen baronets, four
      commanders of the forces in Scotland, and five eminent men,&rsquo;&mdash;fine
      game indeed for Mally Lee!
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;A&rsquo; doun alang the Canongate
     Were beaux o&rsquo; ilk degree;
   And mony ane turned round to look
     At bonny Mally Lee.
   And we&rsquo;re a&rsquo; gaun east an&rsquo; west,
     We&rsquo;re a&rsquo; gaun agee,
   We&rsquo;re a&rsquo; gaun east an&rsquo; west

    <p>
      Every corner bristles with memories. Here is the Stamp Office Close, from
      which the lovely Susanna, Countess of Eglinton, was wont to issue on
      assembly nights; she, six feet in height, with a brilliantly fair
      complexion, and a &lsquo;face of the maist bewitching loveliness.&rsquo; Her seven
      daughters and stepdaughters were all conspicuously handsome, and it was
      deemed a goodly sight to watch the long procession of eight gilded
      sedan-chairs pass from the Stamp Office Close, bearing her and her stately
      brood to the Assembly Room, amid a crowd that was &lsquo;hushed with respect and
      admiration to behold their lofty and graceful figures step from the chairs
      on the pavement.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here itself is the site of those old assemblies, presided over at one time
      by the famous Miss Nicky Murray, a directress of society affairs, who
      seems to have been a feminine premonition of Count d&rsquo;Orsay and our own
      M&rsquo;Allister. Rather dull they must have been, those old Scotch balls, where
      Goldsmith saw the ladies and gentlemen in two dismal groups divided by the
      length of the room.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;The Assembly Close received the fair&mdash;
   Order and elegance presided there&mdash;
   Each gay Right Honourable had her place,
   To walk a minuet with becoming grace.
   No racing to the dance with rival hurry,
   Such was thy sway, O famed Miss Nicky Murray!&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      It was half-past nine in the evening when Salemina and I drove to
      Holyrood, our humble cab-horse jogging faithfully behind Lady Baird&rsquo;s
      brougham, and it was the new experience of seeing Auld Reekie by lamplight
      that called up these gay visions of other days,&mdash;visions and days so
      thoroughly our mental property that we could not help resenting the fact
      that women were hanging washing from the Countess of Eglinton&rsquo;s former
      windows, and popping their unkempt heads out of the Duchess of Gordon&rsquo;s
      old doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Reverend Ronald is so kind! He enters so fully into our spirit of
      inquiry, and takes such pleasure in our enthusiasms! He even sprang
      lightly out of Lady Baird&rsquo;s carriage and called to our &lsquo;lamiter&rsquo; to halt
      while he showed us the site of the Black Turnpike, from whose windows
      Queen Mary saw the last of her kingdom&rsquo;s capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here was the Black Turnpike, Miss Hamilton!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;and from here
      Mary went to Loch Leven, where you Hamiltons and the Setons came gallantly
      to her help. Don&rsquo;t you remember the &lsquo;far ride to the Solway sands?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked with interest, though I was in such a state of delicious
      excitement that I could scarce keep my seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a few minutes more, Salemina,&rdquo; I sighed, &ldquo;and we shall be in the
      palace courtyard; then a probable half-hour in crowded dressing-rooms,
      with another half-hour in line, and then, then we shall be making our best
      republican bow in the Gallery of the Kings! How I wish Mr. Beresford and
      Francesca were with us! What do you suppose was her real reason for
      staying away? Some petty disagreement with our young minister, I am sure.
      Do you think the dampness is taking the curl out of our hair? Do you
      suppose our gowns will be torn to ribbons before the Marchioness sees
      them? Do you believe we shall look as well as anybody? Privately, I think
      we must look better than anybody; but I always think that on my way to a
      party, never after I arrive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. M&rsquo;Collop had asserted that I was &lsquo;bonnie eneuch for ony court,&rsquo; and I
      could not help wishing that &lsquo;mine ain dear Somebody&rsquo; might see me in my
      French frock embroidered with silver thistles, and my &lsquo;shower bouquet&rsquo; of
      Scottish bluebells tied loosely together. Salemina wore pinky-purple
      velvet; a real heather colour it was, though the Lord High Commissioner
      would probably never note the fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we had presented our cards of invitation at the palace doors, we
      joined the throng and patiently made our way up the splendid staircases,
      past powdered lackeys without number, and, divested of our wraps, joined
      another throng on our way to the throne-room, Salemina and I pressing
      those cards with our names &lsquo;legibly written on them&rsquo; close to our
      palpitating breasts.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the moment came when, Lady Baird having preceded me, I handed my
      bit of pasteboard to the usher; and hearing &lsquo;Miss Hamilton&rsquo; called in
      stentorian accents, I went forward in my turn, and executed a graceful and
      elegant, but not too profound curtsy, carefully arranged to suit the
      semi-royal, semi-ecclesiastical occasion. I had not divulged that fact
      even to Salemina, but I had worn Mrs. M&rsquo;Collop&rsquo;s carpet quite threadbare
      in front of the long mirror, and had curtsied to myself so many times in
      its crystal surface that I had developed a sort of fictitious reverence
      for my reflected image. I had only begun my well-practised obeisance when
      Her Grace the Marchioness, to my mingled surprise and embarrassment,
      extended a gracious hand and murmured my name in a particularly kind
      voice. She is fond of Lady Baird, and perhaps chose this method of showing
      her friendship; or it may be that she noticed my silver thistles and
      Salemina&rsquo;s heather-coloured velvet,&mdash;they certainly deserved special
      recognition; or it may be that I was too beautiful to pass over in
      silence,&mdash;in my state of exaltation I was quite equal to the belief.
    </p>
    <p>
      The presentation over, we wandered through the spacious apartments,
      leaning from the open windows to hear the music of the band playing in the
      courtyard below, looking at the royal portraits, and chatting with groups
      of friends who appeared and reappeared in the throng. Finally Lady Baird
      sent for us to join her in a knot of personages more or less
      distinguished, who had dined at the palace, and who were standing behind
      the receiving party in a sort of sacred group. This indeed was a ground of
      vantage, and one could have stood there for hours, watching all sorts and
      conditions of men and women bowing before the Lord High Commissioner and
      the Marchioness, who, with her Cleopatra-like beauty and scarlet gown,
      looked like a gorgeous cardinal-flower.
    </p>
    <p>
      Salemina and I watched the curtsying narrowly, with the view at first of
      improving our own obeisances for Buckingham Palace; but truth to say we
      got no added light, and plainly most of the people had not worn threadbare
      the carpets in front of their dressing-mirrors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly we heard a familiar name announced, &lsquo;Lord Colquhoun,&rsquo; a
      distinguished judge who had lately been raised to the peerage, and whom we
      often met at dinners; then &lsquo;Miss Rowena Colquhoun&rsquo;; and then in the midst,
      we fancied, of an unusual stir at the entrance door&mdash;&lsquo;Miss Francesca
      Van Buren Monroe.&rsquo; I involuntarily touched the Reverend Ronald&rsquo;s shoulder
      in my astonishment, while Salemina lifted her tortoise-shell lorgnette,
      and we gazed silently at our recreant charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      After presentation, each person has fifteen or twenty feet of awful space
      to traverse in solitary and defenceless majesty; scanned meanwhile by the
      maids of honour (who if they were truly honourable, would turn their eyes
      another way), ladies-in-waiting, the sacred group in the rear, and the
      Purse-Bearer himself. I had supposed that this functionary would keep the
      purse in his upper bureau drawer at home, when he was not paying bills,
      but it seems that when on processional duty he carries a bag of red velvet
      quite a yard long over his arm, where it looks not unlike a lady&rsquo;s
      opera-cloak. It would hold the sum-total of all moneys disbursed, even if
      they were reduced to the standard of vulgar copper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under this appalling fire of inspection, some of the victims waddle, some
      hurry; some look up and down nervously, others glance over the shoulder as
      if dreading to be apprehended; some turn red, others pale, according to
      complexion and temperament; some swing their arms, other trip on their
      gowns; some twitch the buttons of a glove, or tweak a flower or a jewel.
      Francesca rose superior to all these weaknesses, and I doubt if the
      Gallery of the Kings ever served as a background for anything lovelier or
      more high-bred than that untitled slip of a girl from &lsquo;the States.&rsquo; Her
      trailing gown of pearl-white satin fell in unbroken lustrous folds behind
      her. Her beautiful throat and shoulders rose in statuesque whiteness from
      the mist of chiffon that encircled them. Her dark hair showed a moonbeam
      parting that rested the eye, wearied by the contemplation of waves and
      frizzes fresh from the curling-tongs. Her mother&rsquo;s pearls hung in ropes
      from neck to waist, and the one spot of colour about her was the single
      American Beauty rose she carried. There is a patriotic florist in Paris
      who grows these long-stemmed empresses of the rose-garden, and Mr.
      Beresford sends some to me every week. Francesca had taken the flower
      without permission, and I must say she was as worthy of it as it of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She curtsied deeply, with no exaggerated ceremony, but with a sort of
      innocent and childlike gravity, while the satin of her gown spread itself
      like a great blossom over the floor. Her head was bowed until the dark
      lashes swept her crimson cheeks; then she rose again from the heart of the
      shimmering lily, with the one splendid rose glowing against all her
      dazzling whiteness, and floated slowly across the dreaded space to the
      door of exit as if she were preceded by invisible heralds and followed by
      invisible train-bearers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo; we heard whispered here and there. &ldquo;Look at the rose!&rdquo; &ldquo;Look
      at the pearls! Is she a princess or only an American?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I glanced at the Reverend Ronald. I imagined he looked pale; at any rate
      he was biting his under lip nervously, and I believe he was in fancy
      laying his serious, Scottish, allopathic, Presbyterian heart at
      Francesca&rsquo;s gay, American, homoeopathic, Swedenborgian feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a pity Miss Monroe is such an ardent republican,&rdquo; he said, with
      unconcealed bitterness; &ldquo;otherwise she ought to be a duchess. I never saw
      a head that better suited a coronet, nor, if you will pardon me, one that
      contained more caprices.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true she flatly refused to accompany us here,&rdquo; I allowed, &ldquo;but
      perhaps she has some explanation more or less silly and serviceable;
      meantime, I defy you to tell me she isn&rsquo;t a beauty, and I implore you to
      say nothing about its being only skin-deep. Give me a beautiful exterior,
      say I, and I will spend my life in making the hidden things of mind and
      soul conform to it; but deliver me from all forlorn attempts to make my
      beauty of character speak through a large mouth, breathe through a fat
      nose, and look at my neighbour through crossed eyes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Macdonald agreed with me, with some few ministerial reservations. He
      always agrees with me, and why he is not tortured at the thought of my
      being the promised bride of another, but continues to squander his
      affections upon a quarrelsome and unappreciative girl is more than I can
      comprehend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francesca, escorted by Lord Colquhoun, appeared presently in our group,
      but Salemina did not even attempt to scold her. One cannot scold an
      imperious young beauty in white satin and pearls, particularly if she is
      leaning nonchalantly on the arm of a peer of the realm.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems that shortly after our departure (we had dined with Lady Baird),
      Lord Colquhoun had sent a note to me, requiring an answer. Francesca had
      opened it, and found that he offered an extra card of invitation to one of
      us, and said that he and his sister would gladly serve as escort to
      Holyrood, if desired. She had had an hour or two of solitude by this time,
      and was well weary of it, while the last vestige of headache disappeared
      under the temptation of appearing at court with all the eclat of
      unexpectedness. She despatched a note of acceptance to Lord Colquhoun,
      summoned Mrs. M&rsquo;Collop, Susanna, and the maiden Boots to her assistance,
      spread the trays of her Saratoga trunks about our three bedrooms, grouped
      all our candles on her dressing-table, and borrowed any trinket or bit of
      frippery which we chanced to have left behind. Her own store of adornments
      is much greater than ours, but we possess certain articles for which she
      has a childlike admiration: my white satin slippers embroidered with seed
      pearls, Salemina&rsquo;s pearl-topped comb, Salemina&rsquo;s Valenciennes handkerchief
      and diamond belt-clasp, my pearl frog with ruby eyes. We identified our
      property on her impertinent young person, and the list of her borrowings
      so amused the Reverend Ronald that he forgot his injuries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is really an ordeal, that presentation, no matter how strong one&rsquo;s
      sense of humour may be, nor how well rooted one&rsquo;s democracy,&rdquo; chattered
      Francesca to a serried rank of officers who surrounded her to the total
      routing of the ministry. &ldquo;It is especially trying if one has come
      unexpectedly and has no idea of what is to happen. I was agitated at the
      supreme moment, because, at the entrance of the throne-room, I had just
      shaken hands reverently with a splendid person who proved to be a footman.
      Of course I took him for the Commander of the Queen&rsquo;s Guards, or the
      Keeper of the Dungeon Keys, or the Most Noble Custodian of the Royal
      Moats, Drawbridges, and Portcullises. When he put out his hand I had no
      idea it was simply to waft me onward, and so naturally I shook it,&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      a mercy that I didn&rsquo;t kiss it! Then I curtsied to the Royal Usher, and
      overlooked the Lord High Commissioner altogether, having no eyes for any
      one but the beautiful scarlet Marchioness. I only hope they were too busy
      to notice my mistakes, otherwise I shall be banished from Court at the
      very moment of my presentation.&mdash;Do you still banish nowadays?&rdquo;
       turning the battery of her eyes upon a particularly insignificant officer
      who was far too dazed to answer. &ldquo;And did you see the child of ten who was
      next to me in line? She is Mrs. Macstronachlacher; at least that was the
      name on the card she carried, and she was thus announced. As they tell us
      the Purse-Bearer is most rigorous in arranging these functions and issuing
      the invitations, I presume she must be Mrs. Macstronachlacher; but if so,
      they marry very young in Scotland, and her skirts should really have been
      longer!&rdquo;

      Chapter XII. Farewell to Edinburgh.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is our last day in &lsquo;Scotia&rsquo;s darling seat,&rsquo; our last day in Breadalbane
      Terrace, our last day with Mrs. M&rsquo;Collop; and though every one says that
      we shall love the life in the country, we are loath to leave Auld Reekie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Salemina and I have spent two days in search of an abiding-place, and have
      visited eight well-recommended villages with that end in view; but she
      disliked four of them, and I couldn&rsquo;t endure the other four, though I
      considered some of those that fell under her disapproval as quite
      delightful in every respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      We never take Francesca on these pilgrimages of disagreement, as three
      conflicting opinions on the same subject would make insupportable what is
      otherwise rather exhilarating. She starts from Edinburgh to-morrow for a
      brief visit to the Highlands with the Dalziels, and will join us when we
      have settled ourselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Beresford leaves Paris as soon after our decision as he is permitted,
      so Salemina and I have agreed to agree upon one ideal spot within
      thirty-six hours of our quitting Edinburgh, knowing privately that after a
      last battle-royal we shall enthusiastically support the joint decision for
      the rest of our lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have been bidding good-bye to people and places and things, and wishing
      the sun would not shine and thus make our task the harder. We have looked
      our last on the old grey town from Calton Hill, of all places the best,
      perhaps, for a view; since, as Stevenson says, from Calton Hill you can
      see the Castle, which you lose from the Castle, and Arthur&rsquo;s Seat, which
      you cannot see from Arthur&rsquo;s Seat. We have taken a farewell walk to the
      Dean Bridge, to gaze wistfully eastward and marvel for the hundredth time
      to find so beautiful a spot in the heart of a city. The soft-flowing Water
      of Leith winding over pebbles between grassy banks and groups of splendid
      trees, the roof of the little temple to Hygeia rising picturesquely among
      green branches, the slopes of emerald velvet leading up to the grey stone
      of the houses,&mdash;where, in all the world of cities, can one find a
      view to equal it in peaceful loveliness? Francesca&rsquo;s &lsquo;bridge-man,&rsquo; who, by
      the way, proved to be a distinguished young professor of medicine in the
      University, says that the beautiful cities of the world should be ranked
      thus,&mdash;Constantinople, Prague, Genoa, Edinburgh; but having seen only
      one of these, and that the last, I refuse to credit any sliding scale of
      comparison which leaves Edina at the foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nearing tea-time, an hour when we never fail to have visitors, and
      we were all in the drawing-room together. I was at the piano, singing
      Jacobite melodies for Salemina&rsquo;s delectation. When I came to the last
      verse of Lady Nairne&rsquo;s &lsquo;Hundred Pipers,&rsquo; the spirited words had taken my
      fancy captive, and I am sure I could not have sung with more vigour and
      passion had my people been &lsquo;out with the Chevalier.&rsquo; 
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;The Esk was swollen sae red an&rsquo; sae deep,
   But shouther to shouther the brave lads keep;
   Twa thousand swam owre to fell English ground,
   An&rsquo; danced themselves dry to the pibroch&rsquo;s sound.
   Dumfounder&rsquo;d the English saw, they saw,
   Dumfounder&rsquo;d they heard the blaw, the blaw,
   Dumfounder&rsquo;d they a&rsquo; ran awa&rsquo;, awa&rsquo;,
   Frae the hundred pipers an&rsquo; a&rsquo;, an&rsquo; a&rsquo;!&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      By the time I came to &lsquo;Dumfounder&rsquo;d the English saw,&rsquo; Francesca left her
      book and joined in the next four lines, and when we broke into the chorus
      Salemina rushed to the piano, and although she cannot sing, she lifted her
      voice both high and loud in the refrain, beating time the while with a
      dirk paper-knife.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;Wi&rsquo; a hundred pipers an&rsquo; a&rsquo;, an&rsquo; a&rsquo;,
   Wi&rsquo; a hundred pipers an&rsquo; a&rsquo;, an&rsquo; a&rsquo;,
   We&rsquo;ll up an&rsquo; gie them a blaw, a blaw,
   Wi&rsquo; a hundred pipers an&rsquo; a&rsquo;, an&rsquo; a&rsquo;!&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      Susanna ushered in Mr. Macdonald and Dr. Moncrieffe as the last &lsquo;blaw&rsquo; 
      faded into silence, and Jean Dalziel came upstairs to say that they could
      seldom get a quiet moment for family prayers, because we were always at
      the piano, hurling incendiary sentiments into the air,&mdash;sentiments
      set to such stirring melodies that no one could resist them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are very sorry, Miss Dalziel,&rdquo; I said penitently. &ldquo;We reserve an hour
      in the morning and another at bedtime for your uncle&rsquo;s prayers, but we had
      no idea you had them at afternoon tea, even in Scotland. I believe that
      you are chaffing, and came up only to swell the chorus. Come, let us all
      sing together from &lsquo;Dumfounder&rsquo;d the English saw.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Macdonald and Dr. Moncrieffe gave such splendid body to the music, and
      Jean such warlike energy, that Salemina waved her paper-knife in a manner
      more than ever sanguinary, and Susanna, hesitating outside the door for
      sheer delight, had to be coaxed in with the tea-things. On the heels of
      the tea-things came the Dominie, another dear old friend of six weeks&rsquo; 
      standing; and while the doctor sang &lsquo;Jock o&rsquo; Hazeldean&rsquo; with such
      irresistible charm that we all longed to elope with somebody on the
      instant, Salemina dispensed buttered toast, marmalade sandwiches, and the
      fragrant cup. By this time we were thoroughly cosy, and Mr. Macdonald made
      himself and us very much at home by stirring the fire; whereupon Francesca
      embarrassed him by begging him not to touch it unless he could do it
      properly, which, she added, seemed quite unlikely, from the way in which
      he handled the poker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will Edinburgh do without you?&rdquo; he asked, turning towards us with
      flattering sadness in his tone. &ldquo;Who will hear our Scotch stories, never
      suspecting their hoary old age? Who will ask us questions to which we
      somehow always know the answers? Who will make us study and reverence anew
      our own landmarks? Who will keep warm our national and local pride by
      judicious enthusiasm?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think the national and local pride may be counted on to exist without
      any artificial stimulants,&rdquo; dryly observed Francesca, whose spirit is not
      in the least quenched by approaching departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; answered the Reverend Ronald; &ldquo;but at any rate, you, Miss
      Monroe, will always be able to reflect that you have never been
      responsible even for its momentary inflation!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it strange that she cannot get on better with that charming
      fellow?&rdquo; murmured Salemina, as she passed me the sugar for my second cup.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If your present symptoms of blindness continue, Salemina,&rdquo; I said,
      searching for a small lump so as to gain time, &ldquo;I shall write you a
      plaintive ballad, buy you a dog, and stand you on a street corner! If you
      had ever permitted yourself to &lsquo;get on&rsquo; with any man as Francesca is
      getting on with Mr. Macdonald, you would now be Mrs.&mdash;Somebody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, doctor,&rdquo; asked the Dominie, &ldquo;that Miss Hamilton shed real
      tears at Holyrood the other night, when the band played &lsquo;Bonnie Charlie&rsquo;s
      noo awa&rsquo;?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were real,&rdquo; I confessed, &ldquo;in the sense that they certainly were not
      crocodile tears; but I am somewhat at a loss to explain them from a
      sensible, American standpoint. Of course my Jacobitism is purely
      impersonal, though scarcely more so than yours, at this late day; at least
      it is merely a poetic sentiment, for which Caroline, Baroness Nairne, is
      mainly responsible. My romantic tears came from a vision of the Bonnie
      Prince as he entered Holyrood, dressed in his short tartan coat, his
      scarlet breeches and military boots, the star of St. Andrew on his breast,
      a blue ribbon over his shoulder, and the famous blue velvet bonnet and
      white cockade. He must have looked so brave and handsome and hopeful at
      that moment, and the moment was so sadly brief, that when the band played
      the plaintive air I kept hearing the words&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;Mony a heart will break in twa,
   Should he no come back again.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      He did come back again to me that evening, and held a phantom levee behind
      the Marchioness of Heatherdale&rsquo;s shoulder. His &lsquo;ghaist&rsquo; looked bonnie and
      rosy and confident, yet all the time the band was playing the requiem for
      his lost cause and buried hopes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked towards the fire to hide the moisture that crept again into my
      eyes, and my glance fell upon Francesca sitting dreamily on a hassock in
      front of the cheerful blaze, her chin in the hollow of her palm, and the
      Reverend Ronald standing on the hearth-rug gazing at her, the poker in his
      hand, and his heart, I regret to say, in such an exposed position on his
      sleeve that even Salemina could have seen it had she turned her eyes that
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean Dalziel broke the momentary silence: &ldquo;I am sure I never hear the last
      two lines&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;Better lo&rsquo;ed ye canna be,
   Will ye no&rsquo; come back again?&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      without a lump in my throat,&rdquo; and she hummed the lovely melody. &ldquo;It is all
      as you say, purely impersonal and poetic. My mother is an Englishwoman,
      but she sings &lsquo;Dumfounder&rsquo;d the English saw, they saw&rsquo; with the greatest
      fire and fury.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      Chapter XIII. The spell of Scotland.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I was never so completely under the spell of a country as I am of
      Scotland.&rdquo; I made this acknowledgment freely, but I knew that it would
      provoke comment from my compatriots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, my dear, you have been just as spellbound before, only you don&rsquo;t
      remember it,&rdquo; replied Salemina promptly. &ldquo;I have never seen a person more
      perilously appreciative or receptive than you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Perilously&rsquo; is just the word,&rdquo; chimed in Francesca delightedly; &ldquo;when
      you care for a place you grow porous, as it were, until after a time you
      are precisely like blotting-paper. Now, there was Italy, for example.
      After eight weeks in Venice, you were completely Venetian, from your fan
      to the ridiculous little crepe shawl you wore because an Italian prince
      had told you that centuries were usually needed to teach a woman how to
      wear a shawl, but that you had been born with the art, and the shoulders!
      Anything but a watery street was repulsive to you. Cobblestones?
      &lsquo;Ordinario, duro, brutto! A gondola? Ah, bellissima! Let me float for ever
      thus!&rsquo; You bathed your spirit in sunshine and colour; I can hear you
      murmur now, &lsquo;O Venezia benedetta! non ti voglio lasciar!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was just the same when she spent a month in France with the Baroness
      de Hautenoblesse,&rdquo; continued Salemina. &ldquo;When she returned to America, it
      is no flattery to say that in dress, attitude, inflection, manner, she was
      a thorough Parisienne. There was an elegant superficiality and a
      superficial elegance about her that I can never forget, nor yet her
      extraordinary volubility in a foreign language,&mdash;the fluency with
      which she expressed her inmost soul on all topics without the aid of a
      single irregular verb, for these she was never able to acquire; oh, it was
      wonderful, but there was no affectation about it; she had simply been a
      kind of blotting-paper, as Miss Monroe says, and France had written itself
      all over her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish to interfere with anybody&rsquo;s diagnosis,&rdquo; I interposed at the
      first possible moment, &ldquo;but perhaps after you&rsquo;ve both finished your
      psychologic investigation the subject may be allowed to explain herself
      from the inside, so to speak. I won&rsquo;t deny the spell of Italy, but I think
      the spell that Scotland casts over one is quite a different thing, more
      spiritual, more difficult to break. Italy&rsquo;s charm has something physical
      in it; it is born of blue sky, sunlit waves, soft atmosphere, orange
      sails, and yellow moons, and appeals more to the senses. In Scotland the
      climate certainly has nought to do with it, but the imagination is somehow
      made captive. I am not enthralled by the past of Italy or France, for
      instance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you are not at the present moment,&rdquo; said Francesca, &ldquo;because
      you are enthralled by the past of Scotland, and even you cannot be the
      slave of two pasts at the same time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never was particularly enthralled by Italy&rsquo;s past,&rdquo; I argued with
      exemplary patience, &ldquo;but the romance of Scotland has a flavour all its
      own. I do not quite know the secret of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the kilts and the pipes,&rdquo; said Francesca.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, the history.&rdquo; (This from Salemina.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or Sir Walter and the literature,&rdquo; suggested Mr. Macdonald.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 &ldquo;Or the songs and ballads,&rdquo; ventured Jean Dalziel.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; I exclaimed triumphantly, &ldquo;you see for yourselves you have named
      avenue after avenue along which one&rsquo;s mind is led in charmed subjection.
      Where can you find battles that kindle your fancy like Falkirk and Flodden
      and Culloden and Bannockburn? Where a sovereign that attracts, baffles,
      repels, allures, like Mary Queen of Scots,&mdash;and where, tell me where,
      is there a Pretender like Bonnie Prince Charlie? Think of the spirit in
      those old Scottish matrons who could sing&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll sell my rock, I&rsquo;ll sell my reel,
   My rippling-kame and spinning-wheel,
   To buy my lad a tartan plaid,
   A braidsword, durk and white cockade.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; chimed in Salemina when I had finished quoting, &ldquo;or that other
      verse that goes&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;I ance had sons, I now hae nane,
     I bare them toiling sairlie;
   But I would bear them a&rsquo; again
     To lose them a&rsquo; for Charlie!&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      Isn&rsquo;t the enthusiasm almost beyond belief at this distance of time?&rdquo; she
      went on; &ldquo;and isn&rsquo;t it a curious fact, as Mr. Macdonald told me a moment
      ago, that though the whole country was vocal with songs for the lost cause
      and the fallen race, not one in favour of the victors ever became
      popular?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sympathy for the under dog, as Miss Monroe&rsquo;s countrywomen would say
      picturesquely,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Macdonald.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why all the vulgarisms in the dictionary should be foisted on
      the American girl,&rdquo; retorted Francesca loftily, &ldquo;unless, indeed, it is a
      determined attempt to find spots upon the sun for fear we shall worship
      it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so, quite so!&rdquo; returned the Reverend Ronald, who has had reason to
      know that this phrase reduces Miss Monroe to voiceless rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Stuart charm and personal magnetism must have been a powerful factor
      in all that movement,&rdquo; said Salemina, plunging hastily back into the topic
      to avert any further recrimination. &ldquo;I suppose we feel it even now, and if
      I had been alive in 1745 I should probably have made myself ridiculous.
      &lsquo;Old maiden ladies,&rsquo; I read this morning, &lsquo;were the last leal Jacobites in
      Edinburgh; spinsterhood in its loneliness remained ever true to Prince
      Charlie and the vanished dreams of youth.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; continued the Dominie, &ldquo;the story is told of the last of those
      Jacobite ladies who never failed to close her Prayer-Book and stand erect
      in silent protest when the prayer for &lsquo;King George III. and the reigning
      family&rsquo; was read by the congregation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember the prayer of the Reverend Neil M&rsquo;Vicar in St.
      Cuthbert&rsquo;s?&rdquo; asked Mr. Macdonald. &ldquo;It was in 1745, after the victory at
      Prestonpans, when a message was sent to the Edinburgh ministers, in the
      name of &lsquo;Charles, Prince Regent&rsquo; desiring them to open their churches next
      day as usual. M&rsquo;Vicar preached to a large congregation, many of whom were
      armed Highlanders, and prayed for George II., and also for Charles Edward,
      in the following fashion: &lsquo;Bless the king! Thou knowest what king I mean.
      May the crown sit long upon his head! As for that young man who has come
      among us to seek an earthly crown, we beseech Thee to take him to Thyself,
      and give him a crown of glory!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, what a pity the Bonnie Prince had not died after his meteor victory
      at Falkirk!&rdquo; exclaimed Jean Dalziel, when we had finished laughing at Mr.
      Macdonald&rsquo;s story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or at Culloden, &lsquo;where, quenched in blood on the Muir of Drummossie, the
      star of the Stuarts sank forever,&rsquo;&rdquo; quoted the Dominie. &ldquo;There is where
      his better self died; would that the young Chevalier had died with it! By
      the way, doctor, we must not sit here eating goodies and sipping tea until
      the dinner-hour, for these ladies have doubtless much to do for their
      flitting&rdquo; (a pretty Scots word for &lsquo;moving&rsquo;).
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are quite ready for our flitting so far as packing is concerned,&rdquo;
       Salemina assured him. &ldquo;Would that we were as ready in spirit! Miss
      Hamilton has even written her farewell poem, which I am sure she will read
      for the asking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will read it without that formality,&rdquo; murmured Francesca. &ldquo;She has
      lived and toiled only for this moment, and the poem is in her pocket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delightful!&rdquo; said the doctor flatteringly. &ldquo;Has she favoured you already?
      Have you heard it, Miss Monroe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have we heard it!&rdquo; ejaculated that young person. &ldquo;We have heard nothing
      else all the morning! What you will take for local colour is nothing but
      our mental life-blood, which she has mercilessly drawn to stain her
      verses. We each tried to write a Scottish poem, and as Miss Hamilton&rsquo;s was
      better, or perhaps I might say less bad, than ours, we encouraged her to
      develop and finish it. I wanted to do an imitation of Lindsay&rsquo;s
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;Adieu, Edinburgh! thou heich triumphant town,
   Within whose bounds richt blithefull have I been!
</pre>
    <p>
      but it proved too difficult. Miss Hamilton&rsquo;s general idea was that we
      should write some verses in good plain English. Then we were to take out
      all the final g&rsquo;s, and indeed the final letters from all the words
      wherever it was possible, so that full, awful, call, ball, hall, and away
      should be fu&rsquo;, awfu&rsquo;, ca&rsquo;, ba&rsquo;, ha&rsquo;, an&rsquo; awa&rsquo;. This alone gives great
      charm and character to a poem; but we were also to change all words ending
      in ow into aw. This doesn&rsquo;t injure the verse, you see, as blaw and snaw
      rhyme just as well as blow and snow, beside bringing tears to the common
      eye with their poetic associations. Similarly, if we had daughter and
      slaughter, we were to write them dochter and slauchter, substituting in
      all cases doon, froon, goon, and toon, for down, frown gown, and town.
      Then we made a list of Scottish idols,&mdash;pet words, national
      institutions, stock phrases, beloved objects,&mdash;convinced if we could
      weave them in we should attain &lsquo;atmosphere.&rsquo; Here is the first list; it
      lengthened speedily: thistle, tartan, haar, haggis, kirk, claymore,
      parritch, broom, whin, sporran, whaup, plaid, scone, collops, whisky,
      mutch, cairngorm, oatmeal, brae, kilt, brose, heather. Salemina and I were
      too devoted to common-sense to succeed in this weaving process, so
      Penelope triumphed and won the first prize, both for that and also because
      she brought in a saying given us by Miss Dalziel, about the social
      classification of all Scotland into &lsquo;the gentlemen of the North, men of
      the South, people of the West, fowk o&rsquo; Fife, and the Paisley bodies.&rsquo; We
      think that her success came chiefly from her writing the verses with a
      Scotch plaid lead-pencil. What effect the absorption of so much red, blue,
      and green paint will have I cannot fancy, but she ate off&mdash;and up&mdash;all
      the tartan glaze before finishing the poem; it had a wonderfully
      stimulating effect, but the end is not yet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course there was a chorus of laughter when the young wretch exhibited
      my battered pencil, bought in Princes Street yesterday, its gay Gordon
      tints sadly disfigured by the destroying tooth, not of Time, but of a bard
      in the throes of composition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We bestowed a consolation prize on Salemina,&rdquo; continued Francesca,
      &ldquo;because she succeeded in getting hoots, losh, havers, and blethers into
      one line, but naturally she could not maintain such an ideal standard.
      Read your verses, Pen, though there is little hope that our friends will
      enjoy them as much as you do. Whenever Miss Hamilton writes anything of
      this kind, she emulates her distinguished ancestor Sir William Hamilton,
      who always fell off his own chair in fits of laughter when he was
      composing verses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this inspiring introduction I read my lines as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  AN AMERICAN GIRL&rsquo;S FAREWELL TO EDINBURGH

  The muse being somewhat under the influence of the Scottish ballad

   I canna thole my ain toun,
     Sin&rsquo; I hae dwelt i&rsquo; this;
   To bide in Edinboro&rsquo; reek
     Wad be the tap o&rsquo; bliss.
   Yon bonnie plaid aboot me hap,
     The skirlin&rsquo; pipes gae bring,
   With thistles fair tie up my hair,
     While I of Scotia sing.

   The collops an&rsquo; the cairngorms,
     The haggis an&rsquo; the whin,
   The &lsquo;Staiblished, Free, an&rsquo; U.P. kirks,
     The hairt convinced o&rsquo; sin,&mdash;
   The parritch an&rsquo; the heather-bell,
     The snawdrap on the shaw,
   The bit lam&rsquo;s bleatin&rsquo; on the braes,&mdash;
     How can I leave them a&rsquo;?

   How can I leave the marmalade
     An&rsquo; bonnets o&rsquo; Dundee?
   The haar, the haddies, an&rsquo; the brose,
     The East win&rsquo; blawin&rsquo; free?
   How can I lay my sporran by,
     An&rsquo; sit me doun at hame,
   Wi&rsquo;oot a Hieland philabeg
     Or hyphenated name?

   I lo&rsquo;e the gentry o&rsquo; the North,
     The Southern men I lo&rsquo;e,
   The canty people o&rsquo; the West,
     The Paisley bodies too.
   The pawky folk o&rsquo; Fife are dear,&mdash;
     Sae dear are ane an&rsquo; a&rsquo;,
   That e&rsquo;en to think that we maun pairt
     Maist braks my hairt in twa.

   So fetch me tartans, heather, scones,
     An&rsquo; dye my tresses red;
   I&rsquo;d deck me like th&rsquo; unconquer&rsquo;d Scots,
     Wha hae wi&rsquo; Wallace bled.
   Then bind my claymore to my side,
     My kilt an&rsquo; mutch gae bring;
   While Scottish lays soun&rsquo; i&rsquo; my lugs
     M&rsquo;Kinley&rsquo;s no my king,&mdash;

   For Charlie, bonnie Stuart Prince,
     Has turned me Jacobite;
   I&rsquo;d wear displayed the white cockade.
     An&rsquo; (whiles) for him I&rsquo;ll fight!
   An&rsquo; (whiles) I&rsquo;d fight for a&rsquo; that&rsquo;s Scotch,
     Save whusky an&rsquo; oatmeal,
   For wi&rsquo; their ballads i&rsquo; my bluid,
     Nae Scot could be mair leal!
</pre>
    <p>
      I fancied that I had pitched my verses in so high a key that no one could
      mistake their burlesque intention. What was my confusion, however, to have
      one of the company remark when I finished, &lsquo;Extremely pretty; but a mutch,
      you know, is an article of WOMAN&rsquo;S apparel, and would never be worn with a
      kilt!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Macdonald flung himself gallantly into the breach. He is such a dear
      fellow! So quick, so discriminating, so warm-hearted!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t pick flaws in Miss Hamilton&rsquo;s finest line! That picture of a fair
      American, clad in a kilt and mutch, decked in heather and scones, and
      brandishing a claymore, will live for ever in my memory. Don&rsquo;t clip the
      wings of her imagination! You will be telling her soon that one doesn&rsquo;t
      tie one&rsquo;s hair with thistles, nor couple collops with cairngorms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Somebody sent Francesca a great bunch of yellow broom, late that
      afternoon. There was no name in the box, she said, but at night she wore
      the odorous tips in the bosom of her black dinner-gown, and standing erect
      in her dark hair like golden aigrettes.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she came into my room to say good night, she laid the pretty frock in
      one of my trunks, which was to be filled with garments of fashionable
      society and left behind in Edinburgh. The next moment I chanced to look on
      the floor, and discovered a little card, a bent card with two lines
      written on it:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;Better lo&rsquo;ed ye canna be,
   Will ye no&rsquo; come back again?&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      We have received many invitations in that handwriting. I know it well, and
      so does Francesca, though it is blurred; and the reason for this,
      according to my way of thinking, is that it has been lying next the moist
      stems of flowers, and unless I do her wrong, very near to somebody&rsquo;s warm
      heart as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will not betray her to Salemina, even to gain a victory over that blind
      and deaf but much beloved woman. How could I, with my heart beating high
      at the thought of seeing my ain dear laddie before many days?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   Oh, love, love, lassie,

    </p>
    <p>
      We are in the East Neuk o&rsquo; Fife; we are in Pettybaw; we are neither
      boarders nor lodgers; we are residents, inhabitants, householders, and we
      live (live, mind you) in a wee theekit hoosie in the old loaning. Words
      fail to tell you how absolutely Scotch we are and how blissfully happy. It
      is a happiness, I assure you, achieved through great tribulation. Salemina
      and I travelled many miles in railway trains, and many in various other
      sorts of wheeled vehicles, while the ideal ever beckoned us onward. I was
      determined to find a romantic lodging, Salemina a comfortable one, and
      this special combination of virtues is next to impossible, as every one
      knows. Linghurst was too much of a town; Bonnie Craig had no respectable
      inn; Winnybrae was struggling to be a watering-place; Broomlea had no
      golf-course within ten miles, and we intended to go back to our native
      land and win silver goblets in mixed foursomes; the &lsquo;new toun o&rsquo; Fairlock&rsquo; 
      (which looked centuries old) was delightful, but we could not find
      apartments there; Pinkie Leith was nice, but they were tearing up the
      &lsquo;fore street&rsquo; and laying drain-pipes in it. Strathdee had been highly
      recommended, but it rained when we were in Strathdee, and nobody can
      deliberately settle in a place where it rains during the process of
      deliberation. No train left this moist and dripping hamlet for three
      hours, so we took a covered trap and drove onward in melancholy mood.
      Suddenly the clouds lifted and the rain ceased; the driver thought we
      should be having settled weather now, and put back the top of the
      carriage, saying meanwhile that it was a verra dry simmer this year, and
      that the crops sairly needed shoo&rsquo;rs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, if there is any district in Scotland where for any reason
      droughts are possible, that is where we wish to settle,&rdquo; I whispered to
      Salemina; &ldquo;though, so far as I can see, the Strathdee crops are up to
      their knees in mud. Here is another wee village. What is this place,
      driver?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pettybaw, mam; a fine toun!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will there be apartments to let there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cudna say, mam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Susanna Crum&rsquo;s father! How curious that he should live here!&rdquo; I murmured;
      and at this moment the sun came out, and shone full, or at least almost
      full, on our future home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pettybaw! Petit bois, I suppose,&rdquo; said Salemina; &ldquo;and there, to be sure,
      it is,&mdash;the &lsquo;little wood&rsquo; yonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We drove to the Pettybaw Inn and Posting Establishment, and, alighting,
      dismissed the driver. We had still three good hours of daylight, although
      it was five o&rsquo;clock, and we refreshed ourselves with a delicious cup of
      tea before looking for lodgings. We consulted the greengrocer, the baker,
      and the flesher, about furnished apartments, and started on our quest, not
      regarding the little posting establishment as a possibility. Apartments we
      found to be very scarce, and in one or two places that were quite suitable
      the landlady refused to do any cooking. We wandered from house to house,
      the sun shining brighter and brighter, and Pettybaw looking lovelier and
      lovelier; and as we were refused shelter again and again, we grew more and
      more enamoured, as is the manner of human kind. The blue sea sparkled, and
      Pettybaw Sands gleamed white a mile or two in the distance, the pretty
      stone church raised its curved spire from the green trees, the manse next
      door was hidden in vines, the sheep lay close to the grey stone walls and
      the young lambs nestled beside them, while the song of the burn, tinkling
      merrily down the glade on the edge of which we stood, and the cawing of
      the rooks in the little wood, were the only sounds to be heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Salemina, under the influence of this sylvan solitude, nobly declared that
      she could and would do without a set bath-tub, and proposed building a
      cabin and living near to nature&rsquo;s heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, on the whole, we should be more comfortable living near to the
      innkeeper&rsquo;s heart,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;Let us go back there and pass the night,
      trying thus the bed and breakfast, with a view to seeing what they are
      like&mdash;although they did say in Edinburgh that nobody thinks of living
      in these wayside hostelries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Back we went, accordingly, and after ordering dinner came out and strolled
      idly up the main street. A small sign in the draper&rsquo;s window, heretofore
      overlooked, caught our eye. &lsquo;House and Garden To Let Inquire Within.&rsquo; 
      Inquiring within with all possible speed, we found the draper selling
      winceys, the draper&rsquo;s assistant tidying the ribbon-box, the draper&rsquo;s wife
      sewing in one corner, and the draper&rsquo;s baby playing on the clean floor. We
      were impressed favourably, and entered into negotiations without delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The house will be in the loaning; do you mind, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; asked the draper.
      (We have long since discovered that this use of the verb is a bequest from
      the Gaelic, in which there is no present tense. Man never is, but always
      to be blessed, in that language, which in this particular is not unlike
      old-fashioned Calvinism.)
    </p>
    <p>
      We went out of the back door and down the green loaning, until we came to
      the wee stone cottage in which the draper himself lives most of the year,
      retiring for the warmer months to the back of his shop, and eking out a
      comfortable income by renting his hearth-stone to the summer visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thatched roof on the wing that formed the kitchen attracted my
      artist&rsquo;s eye, and we went in to examine the interior, which we found
      surprisingly attractive. There was a tiny sitting-room, with a fireplace
      and a microscopic piano; a dining-room adorned with portraits of relatives
      who looked nervous when they met my eye, for they knew that they would be
      turned face to the wall on the morrow; four bedrooms, a kitchen, and a
      back garden so filled with vegetables and flowers that we exclaimed with
      astonishment and admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we cannot keep house in Scotland,&rdquo; objected Salemina. &ldquo;Think of the
      care! And what about the servants?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not eat at the inn?&rdquo; I suggested. &ldquo;Think of living in a real loaning,
      Salemina! Look at the stone floor in the kitchen, and the adorable stuffy
      box-bed in the wall! Look at the bust of Sir Walter in the hall, and the
      chromo of Melrose Abbey by moonlight! Look at the lintel over the front
      door, with a ship, moon, stars, and 1602 carved in the stone! What is food
      to all this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Salemina agreed that it was hardly worth considering; and in truth so many
      landladies had refused to receive her as a tenant that day that her
      spirits were rather low, and she was uncommonly flexible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the lintel and the back garden that rents the hoose,&rdquo; remarked the
      draper complacently in broad Scotch that I cannot reproduce. He is a
      house-agent as well as a draper, and went on to tell us that when he had a
      cottage he could rent in no other way he planted plenty of creepers in
      front of it. &ldquo;The baker&rsquo;s hoose is no sae bonnie,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and the linen
      and cutlery verra scanty, but there is a yellow laburnum growin&rsquo; by the
      door: the leddies see that, and forget to ask aboot the linen. It depends
      a good bit on the weather, too; it is easy to let a hoose when the sun
      shines upon it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We hardly dare undertake regular housekeeping,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;do your tenants
      ever take meals at the inn?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cudna say, mam.&rdquo; (Dear, dear, the Crums are a large family!)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we did that, we should still need a servant to keep the house tidy,&rdquo;
       said Salemina, as we walked away. &ldquo;Perhaps housemaids are to be had,
      though not nearer than Edinburgh, I fancy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This gave me an idea, and I slipped over to the post-office while Salemina
      was preparing for dinner, and despatched a telegram to Mrs. M&rsquo;Collop at
      Breadalbane Terrace, asking her if she could send a reliable general
      servant to us, capable of cooking simple breakfasts and caring for a
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had scarcely finished our Scotch broth, fried haddies, mutton-chops,
      and rhubarb tart when I received an answer from Mrs. M&rsquo;Collop to the
      effect that her sister&rsquo;s husband&rsquo;s niece, Jane Grieve, could join us on
      the morrow if we desired. The relationship was an interesting fact, though
      we scarcely thought the information worth the additional pennies we paid
      for it in the telegram; however, Mrs. M&rsquo;Collop&rsquo;s comfortable assurance,
      together with the quality of the rhubarb tart and mutton-chops, brought us
      to a decision. Before going to sleep we rented the draper&rsquo;s house, named
      it Bide-a-Wee Cottage, engaged daily luncheons and dinners for three
      persons at the Pettybaw Inn and Posting Establishment, telegraphed to
      Edinburgh for Jane Grieve, to Callander for Francesca, and despatched a
      letter to Paris for Mr. Beresford, telling him we had taken a &lsquo;wee theekit
      hoosie,&rsquo; and that the &lsquo;yett was ajee&rsquo; whenever he chose to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly it would have been wiser not send for them until we were
      settled,&rdquo; I said reflectively. &ldquo;Jane Grieve may not prove a suitable
      person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The name somehow sounds too young and inexperienced,&rdquo; observed Salemina,
      &ldquo;and what association have I with the phrase &lsquo;sister&rsquo;s husband&rsquo;s niece&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have heard me quote Lewis Carroll&rsquo;s verse, perhaps:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;He thought he saw a buffalo
     Upon the chimney-piece;
   He looked again and found it was
     His sister&rsquo;s husband&rsquo;s niece:
  &ldquo;Unless you leave the house,&rdquo; he said,
    &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send for the police!&rdquo;&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      The only thing that troubles me,&rdquo; I went on, &ldquo;is the question of Willie
      Beresford&rsquo;s place of residence. He expects to be somewhere within easy
      walking or cycling distance,&mdash;four or five miles at most.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t be desolate even if he doesn&rsquo;t have a thatched roof, a pansy
      garden, and a blossoming shrub,&rdquo; said Salemina sleepily, for our business
      arrangements and discussions had lasted well into the evening. &ldquo;What he
      will want is a lodging where he can have frequent sight and speech of you.
      How I dread him! How I resent his sharing of you with us! I don&rsquo;t know why
      I use the word &lsquo;sharing,&rsquo; forsooth! There is nothing half so fair and just
      in his majesty&rsquo;s greedy mind. Well, it&rsquo;s the way of the world; only it is
      odd, with the universe of women to choose from, that he must needs take
      you. Strathdee seems the most desirable place for him, if he has a
      macintosh and rubber boots. Inchcaldy is another town near here that we
      didn&rsquo;t see at all&mdash;that might do; the draper&rsquo;s wife says that we can
      send fine linen to the laundry there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Inchcaldy? Oh yes, I think we heard of it in Edinburgh&mdash;at least I
      have some association with the name: it has a fine golf-course, I believe,
      and very likely we ought to have looked at it, although for my part I have
      no regrets. Nothing can equal Pettybaw; and I am so pleased to be a
      Scottish householder! Aren&rsquo;t we just like Bessie Bell and Mary Gray?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;They were twa bonnie lassies;
   They biggit a bower on yon burnbrae,
   An&rsquo; theekit it ower wi&rsquo; rashes.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      Think of our stone-floored kitchen, Salemina! Think of the real box-bed in
      the wall for little Jane Grieve! She will have red-gold hair, blue eyes,
      and a pink cotton gown. Think of our own cat! Think how Francesca will
      admire the 1602 lintel! Think of our back garden, with our own &lsquo;neeps&rsquo; and
      vegetable marrows growing in it! Think how they will envy us at home when
      they learn that we have settled down into Scottish yeowomen!
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;It&rsquo;s oh, for a patch of land!
   It&rsquo;s oh, for a patch of land!
   Of all the blessings tongue can name,
   There&rsquo;s nane like a patch of land!&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      Think of Willie coming to step on the floor and look at the bed and stroke
      the cat and covet the lintel and walk in the garden and weed the turnips
      and pluck the marrows that grow by our ain wee theekit hoosie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Penelope, you appear slightly intoxicated! Do close the window and come
      to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am intoxicated with the caller air of Pettybaw,&rdquo; I rejoined, leaning on
      the window-sill and looking at the stars, while I thought: &ldquo;Edinburgh was
      beautiful; it is the most beautiful grey city in the world; it lacked one
      thing only to make it perfect, and Pettybaw will have that before many
      moons:&mdash;

      Earl Richard&rsquo;s Wedding.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day was one of the most cheerful and one of the most fatiguing
      that I ever spent. Salemina and I moved every article of furniture in our
      wee theekit hoosie from the place where it originally stood to another and
      a better place: arguing, of course, over the precise spot it should
      occupy, which was generally upstairs if the thing were already down, or
      downstairs if it were already up. We hid all the more hideous ornaments of
      the draper&rsquo;s wife, and folded away her most objectionable tidies and
      table-covers, replacing them with our own pretty draperies. There were
      only two pictures in the sitting-room, and as an artist I would not have
      parted with them for worlds. The first was The Life of a Fireman, which
      could only remind one of the explosion of a mammoth tomato, and the other
      was The Spirit of Poetry calling Burns from the Plough. Burns wore white
      knee-breeches, military boots, a splendid waistcoat with lace ruffles, and
      carried a cocked hat. To have been so dressed he must have known the
      Spirit was intending to come. The plough-horse was a magnificent Arabian,
      whose tail swept the freshly furrowed earth, while the Spirit of Poetry
      was issuing from a practicable wigwam on the left, and was a lady of such
      ample dimensions that no poet would have dared say &lsquo;no&rsquo; when she called
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dining-room was blighted by framed photographs of the draper&rsquo;s
      relations and the draper&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s relations; all uniformly ugly. It seems
      strange that married couples having the least beauty to bequeath to their
      offspring should persist in having the largest families. These ladies and
      gentlemen were too numerous to remove, so we obscured them with trailing
      branches; reflecting that we only breakfasted in the room, and the morning
      meal is easily digested when one lives in the open air. We arranged
      flowers everywhere, and bought potted plants at a little nursery hard by.
      We apportioned the bedrooms, giving Francesca the hardest bed,&mdash;as
      she is the youngest, and wasn&rsquo;t here to choose,&mdash;me the next hardest,
      and Salemina the best; Francesca the largest looking-glass and wardrobe,
      me the best view, and Salemina the largest bath. We bought housekeeping
      stores, distributing our patronage equally between the two grocers; we
      purchased aprons and dust-cloths from the rival drapers, engaged bread and
      rolls from the baker, milk and cream from the plumber (who keeps three
      cows), interviewed the flesher about chops; in fact, no young couple
      facing love in a cottage ever had a busier or happier time than we; and at
      sundown, when Francesca arrived, we were in the pink of order, standing
      under our own lintel, ready to welcome her to Pettybaw. As to being
      strangers in a strange land, we had a bowing acquaintance with everybody
      on the main street of the tiny village, and were on terms of considerable
      intimacy with half a dozen families, including dogs and babies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francesca was delighted with everything, from the station (Pettybaw Sands,
      two miles away) to Jane Grieve&rsquo;s name, which she thought as perfect, in
      its way, as Susanna Crum&rsquo;s. She had purchased a &lsquo;tirling-pin,&rsquo; that
      old-time precursor of knockers and bells, at an antique shop in Oban, and
      we fastened it on the front door at once, taking turns at risping it until
      our own nerves were shattered, and the draper&rsquo;s wife ran down the loaning
      to see if we were in need of anything. The twisted bar of iron stands out
      from the door and the ring is drawn up and down over a series of nicks,
      making a rasping noise. The lovers and ghaists in the old ballads always
      &lsquo;tirled at the pin,&rsquo; you remember; that is, touched it gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francesca brought us letters from Edinburgh, and what was my joy, in
      opening Willie&rsquo;s, to learn that he begged us to find a place in Fifeshire,
      and as near St. Rules or Strathdee as convenient; for in that case he
      could accept an invitation he had just received to visit his friend Robin
      Anstruther, at Rowardennan Castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not the visit at the castle I wish so much, you may be sure,&rdquo; he
      wrote, &ldquo;as the fact that Lady Ardmore will make everything pleasant for
      you. You will like my friend Robin Anstruther, who is Lady Ardmore&rsquo;s
      youngest brother, and who is going to her to be nursed and coddled after a
      baddish accident in the hunting-field. He is very sweet-tempered, and will
      get on well with Francesca&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see the connection,&rdquo; rudely interrupted that spirited young
      person.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose she has more room on her list in the country than she had in
      Edinburgh; but if my remembrance serves me, she always enrolls a goodly
      number of victims, whether she has any immediate use for them or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Beresford&rsquo;s manners have not been improved by his residence in
      Paris,&rdquo; observed Francesca, with resentment in her tone and delight in her
      eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Beresford&rsquo;s manners are always perfect,&rdquo; said Salemina loyally, &ldquo;and
      I have no doubt that this visit to Lady Ardmore will be extremely pleasant
      for him, though very embarrassing to us. If we are thrown into forced
      intimacy with a castle&rdquo; (Salemina spoke of it as if it had fangs and a
      lashing tail), &ldquo;what shall we do in this draper&rsquo;s hut?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Salemina!&rdquo; I expostulated, &ldquo;bears will devour you as they did the
      ungrateful child in the fairy-tale. I wonder at your daring to use the
      word &lsquo;hut&rsquo; in connection with our wee theekit hoosie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will never understand that we are doing all this for the novelty of
      it,&rdquo; she objected. &ldquo;The Scottish nobility and gentry probably never think
      of renting a house for a joke. Imagine Lord and Lady Ardmore, the young
      Ardmores, Robin Anstruther, and Willie Beresford calling upon us in this
      sitting-room! We ourselves would have to sit in the hall and talk in
      through the doorway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All will be well,&rdquo; Francesca assured her soothingly. &ldquo;We shall be
      pardoned much because we are Americans, and will not be expected to know
      any better. Besides, the gifted Miss Hamilton is an artist, and that
      covers a multitude of sins against conventionality. When the castle people
      &lsquo;tirl at the pin,&rsquo; I will appear as the maid, if you like, following your
      example at Mrs Bobby&rsquo;s cottage in Belvern, Pen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it isn&rsquo;t as if there were many houses to choose from, Salemina, nor
      as if Bide-a-Wee cottage were cheap,&rdquo; I continued. &ldquo;Think of the rent we
      pay and keep your head high. Remember that the draper&rsquo;s wife says there is
      nothing half so comfortable in Inchcaldy, although that is twice as large
      a town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;INCHCALDY!&rdquo; ejaculated Francesca, sitting down heavily upon the sofa and
      staring at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Inchcaldy, my dear,&mdash;spelled CALDY, but pronounced CAWDY; the town
      where you are to take your nonsensical little fripperies to be laundered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Inchcaldy? How far away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About five miles, I believe, but a lovely road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she exclaimed bitterly, &ldquo;of course Scotland is a small,
      insignificant country; but, tiny as it is, it presents some liberty of
      choice, and why you need have pitched upon Pettybaw, and brought me here,
      when it is only five miles from Inchcaldy, and a lovely road besides, is
      more than I can understand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what way has Inchcaldy been so unhappy as to offend you?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has not offended me, save that it chances to be Ronald Macdonald&rsquo;s
      parish&mdash;that is all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ronald Macdonald&rsquo;s parish!&rdquo; we repeated automatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly&mdash;you must have heard him mention Inchcaldy; and how queer
      he will think it that I have come to Pettybaw, under all the
      circumstances!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We do not know &lsquo;all the circumstances,&rsquo;&rdquo; quoted Salemina somewhat
      haughtily; &ldquo;and you must remember, my dear, that our opportunities for
      speech with Mr. Macdonald have been very rare when you were present. For
      my part, I was always in such a tremor of anxiety during his visits lest
      one or both of you should descend to blows that I remember no details of
      his conversation. Besides, we did not choose Pettybaw; we discovered it by
      chance as we were driving from Strathdee to St. Rules. How were we to know
      that it was near this fatal Inchcaldy? If you think it best, we will hold
      no communication with the place, and Mr. Macdonald need never know you are
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thought Francesca looked rather startled at this proposition. At all
      events she said hastily, &ldquo;Oh, well, let it go; we could not avoid each
      other long, anyway, although it is very awkward, of course; you see, we
      did not part friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I had never seen you on more cordial terms,&rdquo; remarked Salemina.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you weren&rsquo;t there,&rdquo; answered Francesca unguardedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the station.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What station?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The station in Edinburgh from which I started for the Highlands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never said that he came to see you off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The matter was too unimportant for notice; and the more I think of his
      being here, the less I mind it after all; and so, dull care, begone! When
      I first meet him on the sands or in the loaning, I shall say, &lsquo;Dear me, is
      it Mr. Macdonald! What brought you to our quiet hamlet?&rsquo; (I shall put the
      responsibility on him, you know.) &lsquo;That is the worst of these small
      countries,&mdash;fowk are aye i&rsquo; the gait! When we part for ever in
      America, we are able to stay parted, if we wish.&rsquo; Then he will say, &lsquo;Quite
      so, quite so; but I suppose even you, Miss Monroe, will allow that a
      minister may not move his church to please a lady.&rsquo; &lsquo;Certainly not,&rsquo; I
      shall reply, &lsquo;especially when it is Estaiblished!&rsquo; Then he will laugh, and
      we shall be better friends for a few moments; and then I shall tell him my
      latest story about the Scotchman who prayed, &lsquo;Lord, I do not ask that Thou
      shouldst give me wealth; only show me where it is, and I will attend to
      the rest.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Salemina moaned at the delightful prospect opening before us, while I went
      to the piano and carolled impersonally&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Oh, wherefore did I cross the Forth,
     And leave my love behind me?
   Why did I venture to the north
     With one that did not mind me?
   I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve seen a better limb
     And twenty better faces;
   But still my mind it runs on him
     When I am at the races!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Francesca left the room at this, and closed the door behind her with such
      energy that the bust of Sir Walter rocked on the hall shelf. Running
      upstairs she locked herself in her bedroom, and came down again only to
      help us receive Jane Grieve, who arrived at eight o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      In times of joy Salemina, Francesca, and I occasionally have our trifling
      differences of opinion, but in hours of affliction we are as one flesh. An
      all-wise Providence sent us Jane Grieve for fear that we should be too
      happy in Pettybaw. Plans made in heaven for the discipline of sinful human
      flesh are always successful, and this was no exception.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had sent a &lsquo;machine&rsquo; from the inn to meet her, and when it drew up at
      the door we went forward to greet the rosy little Jane of our fancy. An
      aged person, wearing a rusty black bonnet and shawl, and carrying what
      appeared to be a tin cake-box and a baby&rsquo;s bath-tub, descended
      rheumatically from the vehicle and announced herself as Miss Grieve. She
      was too old to call by her Christian name, too sensitive to call by her
      surname, so Miss Grieve she remained, as announced, to the end of the
      chapter, and our rosy little Jane died before she was actually born. The
      man took her grotesque luggage into the kitchen, and Salemina escorted her
      thither, while Francesca and I fell into each other&rsquo;s arms and laughed
      hysterically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody need tell me that she is Mrs. M&rsquo;Collop&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s husband&rsquo;s
      niece,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;although she may possibly be somebody&rsquo;s
      grand-aunt. Doesn&rsquo;t she remind you of Mrs. Gummidge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Salemina returned in a quarter of an hour, and sank dejectedly on the
      sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run over to the inn, Francesca&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and order bacon and eggs at
      eight-thirty to-morrow morning. Miss Grieve thinks we had better not
      breakfast at home until she becomes accustomed to the surroundings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we allow her to become accustomed to them?&rdquo; I questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She came up from Glasgow to Edinburgh for the day, and went to see Mrs.
      M&rsquo;Collop just as our telegram arrived. She was living with an &lsquo;extremely
      nice family&rsquo; in Glasgow, and only broke her engagement in order to try
      Fifeshire air for the summer; so she will remain with us as long as she is
      benefited by the climate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you pay her for a month and send her away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can we? She is Mrs. M&rsquo;Collop&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s husband&rsquo;s niece, and we
      intend returning to Mrs. M&rsquo;Collop. She has a nice ladylike appearance, but
      when she takes her bonnet off she looks seventy years old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She ought always to keep it off, then,&rdquo; returned Francesca, &ldquo;for she
      looked eighty with it on. We shall have to soothe her last moments, of
      course, and pay her funeral expenses. Did you offer her a cup of tea and
      show her the box-bed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; she said she was muckle obleeged to me, but the coals were so poor
      and hard she couldna batter them up to start a fire the nicht, and she
      would try the box-bed to see if she could sleep in it. I am glad to
      remember that it was you who telegraphed for her, Penelope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let there be no recriminations,&rdquo; I responded; &ldquo;let us stand shoulder to
      shoulder in this calamity,&mdash;isn&rsquo;t there a story called Calamity Jane?
      We might live at the inn, and give her the cottage for a summer residence,
      but I utterly refuse to be parted from our cat and the 1602 lintel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After I have once described Miss Grieve I shall not suffer her to begloom
      these pages as she did our young lives. She is so exactly like her kind in
      America she cannot be looked upon as a national type. Everywhere we go we
      see fresh, fair-haired, sonsie lasses; why should we have been visited by
      this affliction, we who have no courage in a foreign land to rid ourselves
      of it?
    </p>
    <p>
      She appears at the door of the kitchen with some complaint, and stands
      there talking to herself in a depressing murmur until she arrives at the
      next grievance. Whenever we hear this, which is whenever we are in the
      sitting-room, we amuse ourselves by chanting lines of melancholy poetry
      which correspond to the sentiments she seems to be uttering. It is the
      only way the infliction can be endured, for the sitting-room is so small
      that we cannot keep the door closed habitually. The effect of this plan is
      something like the following:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      She. &ldquo;The range has sic a bad draft I canna mak&rsquo; the fire draw!&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  We.  &lsquo;But I&rsquo;m ower auld for the tears to start,
        An&rsquo; sae the sighs maun blaw!&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      She. &ldquo;The clock i&rsquo; the hall doesna strike. I have to get oot o&rsquo; my bed to
      see the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  We.  &lsquo;The broken hairt it kens
        Nae second spring again!&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      She. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no&rsquo; eneuch jugs i&rsquo; the hoose.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  We.  &lsquo;I&rsquo;m downright dizzy wi&rsquo; the thought&mdash;
       In troth I&rsquo;m like to greet!&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      She. &ldquo;The sink drain isna recht.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  We.  &lsquo;An&rsquo; it&rsquo;s oh! to win awa&rsquo;, awa&rsquo;,
        An&rsquo; it&rsquo;s oh! to win awa&rsquo;!&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      She. &ldquo;I canna thole a box-bed!&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">

        Waukin O an&rsquo; weary.

</pre>
    <p>
      She. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fair insultin&rsquo; to rent a hoose wi&rsquo; so few convenience.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  We.  &lsquo;An&rsquo; I&rsquo;m ower auld to fish ony mair,

      to do by her lane.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">

        An&rsquo; I sae weary, fu&rsquo; o&rsquo; care?&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      She. &ldquo;Ah, but that was a fine family I lived wi&rsquo; in Glasgy; an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s a
      wearifu&rsquo; day&rsquo;s work I&rsquo;ve had the day.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  We.  &lsquo;Oh why was I spared to cry, Wae&rsquo;s me!&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      She. &ldquo;Why dinna they leave floo&rsquo;rs i&rsquo; the garden makin&rsquo; a mess i&rsquo; the
      hoose wi&rsquo; &lsquo;em? It&rsquo;s not for the knowin&rsquo; what they will be after next!&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  We.  &lsquo;Oh, waly waly up the bank,
        And waly waly doon the brae!&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      Miss Grieve&rsquo;s plaints never grow less, though we are sometimes at a loss
      for appropriate quotations to match them. The poetic interpolations are
      introduced merely to show the general spirit of her conversation. They
      take the place of her sighs, which are by their nature unprintable. Many
      times each day she is wont to sink into one low chair, and, extending her
      feet in another, close her eyes and murmur undistinguishable plaints which
      come to us in a kind of rhythmic way. She has such a shaking right hand we
      have been obliged to give up coffee and have tea, as the former beverage
      became too unsettled on its journey from the kitchen to the
      breakfast-table. She says she kens she is a guid cook, though salf-praise
      is sma&rsquo; racommendation (sma&rsquo; as it is she will get nae ither!); but we
      have little opportunity to test her skill, as she prepares only our
      breakfasts of eggs and porridge. Visions of home-made goodies had danced
      before our eyes, but as the hall clock doesna strike she is unable to rise
      at any exact hour, and as the range draft is bad, and the coals too hard
      to batter up wi&rsquo; a hatchet, we naturally have to content ourselves with
      the baker&rsquo;s loaf.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this is a truthful portrait of &lsquo;Calamity Jane,&rsquo; our one Pettybaw
      grievance.

      Chapter XVI. The path that led to Crummylowe.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;Gae farer up the burn to Habbie&rsquo;s Howe,
   Where a&rsquo; the sweets o&rsquo; spring an&rsquo; simmer grow:
   Between twa birks, out o&rsquo;er a little lin,
   The water fa&rsquo;s an&rsquo; mak&rsquo;s a singan din;
   A pool breast-deep, beneath as clear as glass,
   Kisses, wi&rsquo; easy whirls, the bord&rsquo;ring grass.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      The Gentle Shepherd.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is what Peggy says to Jenny in Allan Ramsay&rsquo;s poem, and if you
      substitute &lsquo;Crummylowe&rsquo; for &lsquo;Habbie&rsquo;s Howe&rsquo; in the first line, you will
      have a lovely picture of the farm-steadin&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      You come to it by turning the corner from the inn, first passing the
      cottage where the lady wishes to rent two rooms for fifteen shillings a
      week, but will not give much attendance, as she is slightly asthmatic, and
      the house is always as clean as it is this minute, and the view from the
      window looking out on Pettybaw Bay canna be surpassed at ony money. Then
      comes the little house where Will&rsquo;am Beattie&rsquo;s sister Mary died in May,
      and there wasna a bonnier woman in Fife. Next is the cottage with the
      pansy-garden, where the lady in the widow&rsquo;s cap takes five-o&rsquo;clock tea in
      the bay-window, and a snug little supper at eight. She has for the first,
      scones and marmalade, and her tea is in a small black teapot under a red
      cosy with a white muslin cover drawn over it. At eight she has more tea,
      and generally a kippered herring, or a bit of cold mutton left from the
      noon dinner. We note the changes in her bill of fare as we pass hastily
      by, and feel admitted quite into the family secrets. Beyond this
      bay-window, which is so redolent of simple peace and comfort that we long
      to go in and sit down, is the cottage with the double white tulips, the
      cottage with the collie on the front steps, the doctor&rsquo;s house with the
      yellow laburnum tree, and then the house where the Disagreeable Woman
      lives. She has a lovely baby, which, to begin with, is somewhat
      remarkable, as disagreeable women rarely have babies; or else, having had
      them, rapidly lose their disagreeableness&mdash;so rapidly that one has
      not time to notice it. The Disagreeable Woman&rsquo;s house is at the end of the
      row, and across the road is a wicket-gate leading&mdash;Where did it lead?&mdash;that
      was the very point. Along the left, as you lean wistfully over the gate,
      there runs a stone wall topped by a green hedge; and on the right, first
      furrows of pale fawn, then below, furrows of deeper brown, and mulberry,
      and red ploughed earth stretching down to waving fields of green, and
      thence to the sea, grey, misty, opalescent, melting into the pearly white
      clouds, so that one cannot tell where sea ends and sky begins.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a path between the green hedge and the ploughed field, and it
      leads seductively to the farm-steadin&rsquo;; or we felt that it might thus
      lead, if we dared unlatch the wicket gate. Seeing no sign &lsquo;Private Way,&rsquo; 
      &lsquo;Trespassers Not Allowed,&rsquo; or other printed defiance to the stranger, we
      were considering the opening of the gate, when we observed two female
      figures coming toward us along the path, and paused until they should come
      through. It was the Disagreeable Woman (although we knew it not) and an
      elderly friend. We accosted the friend, feeling instinctively that she was
      framed of softer stuff, and asked her if the path were a private one. It
      was a question that had never met her ear before, and she was too dull or
      too discreet to deal with it on the instant. To our amazement, she did not
      even manage to falter, &lsquo;I couldna say.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the path private?&rdquo; I repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is certainly the idea to keep it a little private,&rdquo; said the
      Disagreeable Woman, coming into the conversation without being addressed.
      &ldquo;Where do you wish to go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nowhere in particular. The walk looks so inviting we should like to see
      the end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It goes only to the Farm, and you can reach that by the highroad; it is
      only a half-mile further. Do you wish to call at the Farm?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, oh no; the path is so very pretty that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I see; well, I should call it rather private.&rdquo; And with this she
      departed, leaving us to stand on the outskirts of paradise, while she went
      into her house and stared at us from the window as she played with the
      lovely undeserved baby. But that was not the end of the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      We found ourselves there next day, Francesca and I&mdash;Salemina was too
      proud&mdash;drawn by an insatiable longing to view the beloved and
      forbidden scene. We did not dare to glance at the Disagreeable Woman&rsquo;s
      windows, lest our courage should ooze away, so we opened the gate and
      stole through into the rather private path.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a most lovely path; even if it had not been in a sense prohibited,
      it would still have been lovely, simply on its own merits. There were
      little gaps in the hedge and the wall, through which we peered into a
      daisy-starred pasture, where a white bossy and a herd of flaxen-haired
      cows fed on the sweet green grass. The mellow ploughed earth on the right
      hand stretched down to the shore-line, and a plough-boy walked up and down
      the long, straight furrows whistling &lsquo;My Nannie&rsquo;s awa&rsquo;.&rsquo; Pettybaw is so
      far removed from the music-halls that their cheap songs and strident
      echoes never reach its sylvan shades, and the herd-laddies and plough-boys
      still sweeten their labours with the old classic melodies.
    </p>
    <p>
      We walked on and on, determined to come every day; and we settled that if
      we were accosted by any one, or if our innocent business were demanded,
      Francesca should ask, &lsquo;Does Mrs. Macstronachlacher live here, and has she
      any new-laid eggs?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon the gates of the Farm appeared in sight. There was a cluster of
      buildings, with doves huddling and cooing on the red-tiled roofs,&mdash;dairy
      houses, workmen&rsquo;s cottages, comely rows of haystacks (towering yellow
      things with peaked tops); a little pond with ducks and geese chattering
      together as they paddled about, and for additional music the trickling of
      two tiny burns making &lsquo;a singan din,&rsquo; as they wimpled through the bushes.
      A speckle-breasted thrush perched on a corner of the grey wall and poured
      his heart out. Overhead there was a chorus of rooks in the tall trees, but
      there was no sound of human voice save that of the plough-laddie whistling
      &lsquo;My Nannie&rsquo;s awa&rsquo;.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      We turned our backs on this darling solitude, and retraced our steps
      lingeringly. As we neared the wicket gate again we stood upon a bit of
      jutting rock and peered over the wall, sniffing the hawthorn buds with
      ecstasy. The white bossy drew closer, treading softly on its daisy carpet;
      the wondering cows looked up at us as they peacefully chewed their cuds; a
      man in corduroy breeches came from a corner of the pasture, and with a
      sharp, narrow hoe rooted out a thistle or two that had found their way
      into this sweet feeding-ground. Suddenly we heard the swish of a dress
      behind, and turned, conscience-stricken, though we had in nothing sinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does Mrs. Macstronachlacher live here?&rdquo; stammered Francesca like a
      parrot.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an idiotic time and place for the question. We had certainly
      arranged that she should ask it, but something must be left to the
      judgment in such cases. Francesca was hanging over a stone wall regarding
      a herd of cows in a pasture, and there was no possible shelter for a Mrs.
      Macstronachlacher within a quarter of a mile. What made the remark more
      unfortunate was the fact that, although she had on a different dress and
      bonnet, the person interrogated was the Disagreeable Woman; but Francesca
      is particularly slow in discerning resemblances. She would have gone on
      mechanically asking for new-laid eggs, had I not caught her eye and held
      it sternly. The foe looked at us suspiciously for a moment (Francesca&rsquo;s
      hats are not easily forgotten), and then vanished up the path, to tell the
      people at Crummylowe, I suppose, that their grounds were invested by
      marauding strangers whose curiosity was manifestly the outgrowth of a
      republican government.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she disappeared in one direction, we walked slowly in the other; and
      just as we reached the corner of the pasture where two stone walls meet,
      and where a group of oaks gives grateful shade, we heard children&rsquo;s
      voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; cried somebody; &ldquo;it must be still higher at this end, for the
      tower&mdash;this is where the king will sit. Help me with this heavy one,
      Rafe. Dandie, mind your foot. Why don&rsquo;t you be making the flag for the
      ship?&mdash;and do keep the Wrig away from us till we finish building!&rdquo;

      Chapter XVII. Playing Sir Patrick Spens.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;O lang, lang may the ladyes sit
     Wi&rsquo; their face into their hand,
   Before they see Sir Patrick Spens
     Come sailing to the strand.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      Sir Patrick Spens.
    </p>
    <p>
      We forced our toes into the crevices of the wall and peeped stealthily
      over the top. Two boys of eight or ten years, with two younger children,
      were busily engaged in building a castle. A great pile of stones had been
      hauled to the spot, evidently for the purpose of mending the wall, and
      these were serving as rich material for sport. The oldest of the company,
      a bright-eyed, rosy-cheeked boy in an Eton jacket and broad white collar,
      was obviously commander-in-chief; and the next in size, whom he called
      Rafe, was a laddie of eight, in kilts. These two looked as if they might
      be scions of the aristocracy, while Dandie and the Wrig were fat little
      yokels of another sort. The miniature castle must have been the work of
      several mornings, and was worthy of the respectful but silent admiration
      with which we gazed upon it; but as the last stone was placed in the
      tower, the master builder looked up and spied our interested eyes peering
      at him over the wall. We were properly abashed, and ducked our heads
      discreetly at once, but were reassured by hearing him run rapidly towards
      us, calling, &ldquo;Stop, if you please! Have you anything on just now&mdash;are
      you busy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We answered that we were quite at leisure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then would you mind coming in to help us play &lsquo;Sir Patrick Spens&rsquo;? There
      aren&rsquo;t enough of us to do it nicely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This confidence was touching, and luckily it was not in the least
      misplaced. Playing &lsquo;Sir Patrick Spens&rsquo; was exactly in our line, little as
      he suspected it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come and help?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Simply delighted! Do come, Fanny dear. How can
      we get over the wall?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you the good broken place!&rdquo; cried Sir Apple-Cheek; and
      following his directions we scrambled through, while Rafe took off his
      Highland bonnet ceremoniously and handed us down to earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurrah! now it will be something like fun! Do you know &lsquo;Sir Patrick
      Spens&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every word of it. Don&rsquo;t you want us to pass an examination before you
      allow us in the game?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered gravely; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a great help, of course, to know it, but
      it isn&rsquo;t necessary. I keep the words in my pocket to prompt Dandie, and
      the Wrig can only say two lines, she&rsquo;s so little.&rdquo; (Here he produced some
      tattered leaves torn from a book of ballads.) &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve done it many a time,
      but this is a new Dunfermline Castle, and we are trying the play in a
      different way. Rafe is the king, and Dandie is the &lsquo;eldern knight,&rsquo;&mdash;you
      remember him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly; he sat at the king&rsquo;s right knee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, that&rsquo;s the one! Then Rafe is Sir Patrick part of the time, and
      I the other part, because everybody likes to be him; but there&rsquo;s nobody
      left for the &lsquo;lords o&rsquo; Noroway&rsquo; or the sailors, and the Wrig is the only
      maiden to sit on the shore, and she always forgets to comb her hair and
      weep at the right time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The forgetful and placid Wrig (I afterwards learned that this is a Scots
      word for the youngest bird in the nest) was seated on the grass, with her
      fat hands full of pink thyme and white wild woodruff. The sun shone on her
      curly flaxen head. She wore a dark blue cotton frock with white dots, and
      a short-sleeved pinafore; and though she was utterly useless from a
      dramatic point of view, she was the sweetest little Scotch dumpling I ever
      looked upon. She had been tried and found wanting in most of the principal
      parts of the ballad, but when left out of the performance altogether she
      was wont to scream so lustily that all Crummylowe rushed to her
      assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now let us practise a bit to see if we know what we are going to do,&rdquo;
       said Sir Apple-Cheek. &ldquo;Rafe, you can be Sir Patrick this time. The reason
      why we all like to be Sir Patrick,&rdquo; he explained, turning to me, &ldquo;is that
      the lords o&rsquo; Noroway say to him&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;Ye Scottishmen spend a&rsquo; our King&rsquo;s gowd,
     And a&rsquo; our Queenis fee&rsquo;;
</pre>
    <p>
      and then he answers,&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;&ldquo;Ye lee! ye lee! ye leers loud,
     Fu&rsquo; loudly do ye lee!&rdquo;&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      and a lot of splendid things like that. Well, I&rsquo;ll be the king,&rdquo; and
      accordingly he began:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;The King sits in Dunfermline tower,
     Drinking the bluid-red wine.
  &ldquo;O whaur will I get a skeely skipper
     To sail this new ship o&rsquo; mine?&rdquo;&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      A dead silence ensued, whereupon the king said testily, &ldquo;Now, Dandie, you
      never remember you&rsquo;re the eldern knight; go on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus reminded, Dandie recited:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;O up and spake an eldern knight,
     Sat at the King&rsquo;s right knee:
  &ldquo;Sir Patrick Spens is the best sailor
     That ever sailed the sea.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll write my letter,&rdquo; said the king, who was endeavouring to make
      himself comfortable in his somewhat contracted tower.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;The King has written a braid letter
     And sealed it with his hand;
   And sent it to Sir Patrick Spens,
     Was walking on the strand.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read the letter out loud, Rafe, and then you&rsquo;ll remember what to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;&ldquo;To Noroway! to Noroway!
     To Noroway o&rsquo;er the faem!
    The King&rsquo;s daughter of Noroway,
     &lsquo;Tis thou maun bring her hame,&rdquo;&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      read Rafe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now do the next part!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t; I&rsquo;m going to chuck up that next part. I wish you&rsquo;d do Sir
      Patrick until it comes to &lsquo;Ye lee! &lsquo;ye lee!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, that won&rsquo;t do, Rafe. We have to mix up everybody else, but it&rsquo;s too
      bad to spoil Sir Patrick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll give him to you, then, and be the king. I don&rsquo;t mind so much
      now that we&rsquo;ve got such a good tower; and why can&rsquo;t I stop up there even
      after the ship sets sail and look out over the sea with a telescope?
      That&rsquo;s the way Elizabeth did the time she was king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can stay till you have to come down and be a dead Scots lord. I&rsquo;m not
      going to lie there as I did last time, with nobody but the Wrig for a
      Scots lord, and her forgetting to be dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Apple-Cheek then essayed the hard part &lsquo;chucked up&rsquo; by Rafe. It was
      rather difficult, I confess, as the first four lines were in pantomime,
      and required great versatility:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;The first word that Sir Patrick read,
     Fu&rsquo; loud, loud laughed he:
   The neist word that Sir Patrick read,
     The tear blinded his e&rsquo;e.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      These conflicting emotions successfully simulated, Sir Patrick resumed:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;&ldquo;O wha is he has done this deed,
     And tauld the King o&rsquo; me,&mdash;
   To send us out, at this time o&rsquo; the year,
     To sail upon the sea?&rdquo;&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      Then the king stood up in the unstable tower and shouted his own orders:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;&ldquo;Be it wind, be it weet, be it hail, be it sleet,
     Our ship maun sail the faem;
    The King&rsquo;s daughter o&rsquo; Noroway,
     &lsquo;Tis we maun fetch her hame.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we rig the ship a little better?&rdquo; demanded our stage-manager at
      this juncture. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t half as good as the tower.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes&rsquo; hard work, in which we assisted, produced something a trifle
      more nautical and seaworthy than the first craft. The ground with a few
      boards spread upon it was the deck. Tarpaulin sheets were arranged on
      sticks to represent sails, and we located the vessel so cleverly that two
      slender trees shot out of the middle of it and served as the tall
      topmasts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now let us make believe that we&rsquo;ve hoisted our sails on &lsquo;Mononday morn&rsquo; 
      and been in Noroway &lsquo;weeks but only twae,&rsquo;&rdquo; said our leading man; &ldquo;and
      your time has come now,&rdquo;&mdash;turning to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      We felt indeed that it had; but plucking up sufficient courage for the
      lords o&rsquo; Noroway, we cried accusingly,&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;&ldquo;Ye Scottishmen spend a&rsquo; our King&rsquo;s gowd,
     And a&rsquo; our Queenis fee!&rdquo;&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      Oh but Sir Apple-Cheek was glorious as he roared virtuously:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;&ldquo;Ye lee! ye lee! ye leers loud,
     Fu&rsquo; loudly do you lee!

   &ldquo;For I brocht as much white monie
     As gane my men and me,
    An&rsquo; I brocht a half-fou o&rsquo; gude red gowd
     Out ower the sea wi&rsquo; me.

   &ldquo;But betide me well, betide me wae,
     This day I&rsquo;se leave the shore;
    And never spend my King&rsquo;s monie
     &lsquo;Mong Noroway dogs no more.

   &ldquo;Make ready, make ready, my merry men a&rsquo;,
     Our gude ship sails the morn.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you be the sailors, please!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glad to be anything but Noroway dogs, we recited obediently&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;&ldquo;Now, ever alake, my master dear,
     I fear a deadly storm?
     . . . . . . .
    And if ye gang to sea, master,
     I fear we&rsquo;ll come to harm.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      We added much to the effect of this stanza by flinging ourselves on the
      turf and embracing Sir Patrick&rsquo;s knees, with which touch of melodrama he
      was enchanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came a storm so terrible that I can hardly trust myself to describe
      its fury. The entire corps dramatique personated the elements, and tore
      the gallant ship in twain, while Sir Patrick shouted in the teeth of the
      gale&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;&ldquo;O whaur will I get a gude sailor
     To tak&rsquo; my helm in hand,
    Till I get up to the tall topmast
     To see if I can spy land?&rdquo;&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      I knew the words a trifle better than Francesca, and thus succeeded in
      forestalling her as the fortunate hero&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;&ldquo;O here I am, a sailor gude,
     To tak&rsquo; the helm in hand,
    Till you go up to the tall topmast;
     But I fear ye&rsquo;ll ne&rsquo;er spy land.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      And the heroic sailor was right, for
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &lsquo;He hadna gone a step, a step,
     A step but only ane,
    When a bout flew out o&rsquo; our goodly ship,
     And the saut sea it came in.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      Then we fetched a web o&rsquo; the silken claith, and anither o&rsquo; the twine, as
      our captain bade us; we wapped them into our ship&rsquo;s side and letna the sea
      come in; but in vain, in vain. Laith were the gude Scots lords to weet
      their cork-heeled shune, but they did, and wat their hats abune; for the
      ship sank in spite of their despairing efforts,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &lsquo;And mony was the gude lord&rsquo;s son
     That never mair cam&rsquo; hame.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      Francesca and I were now obliged to creep from under the tarpaulins and
      personate the dishevelled ladies on the strand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will your hair come down?&rdquo; asked the manager gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will and shall,&rdquo; we rejoined; and it did.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &lsquo;The ladies wrang their fingers white,
     The maidens tore their hair.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do tear your hair, Jessie! It&rsquo;s the only thing you have to do, and you
      never do it on time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Wrig made ready to howl with offended pride, but we soothed her, and
      she tore her yellow curls with her chubby hands.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &lsquo;And lang, lang may the maidens sit
     Wi&rsquo; there gowd kaims i&rsquo; the hair,
    A&rsquo; waitin&rsquo; for their ain dear luves,
     For them they&rsquo;ll see nae mair.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      I did a bit of sobbing here that would have been a credit to Sarah
      Siddons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Splendid! Grand!&rdquo; cried Sir Patrick, as he stretched himself fifty
      fathoms below the imaginary surface of the water, and gave explicit
      ante-mortem directions to the other Scots lords to spread themselves out
      in like manner.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &lsquo;Half ower, half ower to Aberdour,
     &lsquo;Tis fifty fathoms deep,
    And there lies gude Sir Patrick Spens,
     Wi&rsquo; the Scots lords at his feet.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it is grand!&rdquo; he repeated jubilantly. &ldquo;If I could only be the king
      and see it all from Dunfermline tower! Could you be Sir Patrick once, do
      you think, now that I have shown you how?&rdquo; he asked Francesca.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I could!&rdquo; she replied, glowing with excitement (and small wonder)
      at being chosen for the principal role.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The only trouble is that you do look awfully like a girl in that white
      frock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Francesca appeared rather ashamed at her natural disqualifications for the
      part of Sir Patrick. &ldquo;If I had only worn my long black cloak!&rdquo; she sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I have an idea!&rdquo; cried the boy. &ldquo;Hand her the minister&rsquo;s gown from
      the hedge, Rafe. You see, Mistress Ogilvie of Crummylowe lent us this old
      gown for a sail; she&rsquo;s doing something to a new one, and this was her
      pattern.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Francesca slipped it on over her white serge, and the Pettybaw parson
      should have seen her with the long veil of her dark locks floating over
      his ministerial garment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems a pity to put up your hair,&rdquo; said the stage manager critically,
      &ldquo;because you look so jolly and wild with it down, but I suppose you must;
      and will you have Rafe&rsquo;s bonnet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yes, she would have Rafe&rsquo;s bonnet; and when she perched it on the side of
      her head and paced the deck restlessly, while the black gown floated
      behind in the breeze, we all cheered with enthusiasm, and, having rebuilt
      the ship, began the play again from the moment of the gale. The wreck was
      more horribly realistic than ever, this time, because of our rehearsal;
      and when I crawled from under the masts and sails to seat myself on the
      beach with the Wrig, I had scarcely strength enough to remove the cooky
      from her hand and set her a-combing her curly locks.
    </p>
    <p>
      When our new Sir Patrick stretched herself on the ocean bed, she fell with
      a despairing wail; her gown spread like a pall over the earth, the
      Highland bonnet came off, and her hair floated over a haphazard pillow of
      Jessie&rsquo;s wildflowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it is fine, that part; but from here is where it always goes wrong!&rdquo;
       cried the king from the castle tower. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad to take the maidens
      away from the strand where they look so bonnie, and Rafe is splendid as
      the gude sailor, but Dandie looks so silly as one little dead Scots lord;
      if we only had one more person, young or old, if he was ever so stupid!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;WOULD I DO?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This unexpected offer came from behind one of the trees that served as
      topmasts, and at the same moment there issued from that delightfully
      secluded retreat Ronald Macdonald, in knickerbockers and a golf-cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly as this apparition came, there was no lack of welcome on the
      children&rsquo;s part. They shouted his name in glee, embraced his legs, and
      pulled him about like affectionate young bears. Confusion reigned for a
      moment, while Sir Patrick rose from her sea grave all in a mist of
      floating hair, from which hung impromptu garlands of pink thyme and green
      grasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allow me to do the honours, please, Jamie,&rdquo; said Mr. Macdonald, when he
      could escape from the children&rsquo;s clutches. &ldquo;Have you been properly
      presented? I suppose not. Ladies, the young Master of Rowardennan. Jamie,
      Miss Hamilton and Miss Monroe from the United States of America.&rdquo; Sir
      Apple-Cheek bowed respectfully. &ldquo;Let me present the Honourable Ralph
      Ardmore, also from the castle, together with Dandie Dinmont and the Wrig
      from Crummylowe. Sir Patrick, it is indeed a pleasure to see you again.
      Must you take off my gown? I had thought it was past use, but it never
      looked so well before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;YOUR gown?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The counterfeit presentment of Sir Patrick vanished as the long drapery
      flew to the hedge whence it came, and there remained only an offended
      young goddess, who swung her dark mane tempestuously to one side, plaited
      it in a thick braid, tossed it back again over her white serge shoulder,
      and crowded on her sailor hat with unnecessary vehemence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, MY gown; whose else could you more appropriately borrow, pray?
      Mistress Ogilvie of Crummylowe presses, sponges, and darns my bachelor
      wardrobe, but I confess I never suspected that she rented it out for
      theatrical purposes. I have been calling upon you in Pettybaw; Lady
      Ardmore was there at the same time. Finding but one of the three American
      Graces at home, I stayed a few moments only, and am now returning to
      Inchcaldy by way of Crummylowe.&rdquo; Here he plucked the gown off the hedge
      and folded it carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we keep it for a sail, Mr. Macdonald?&rdquo; pleaded Jamie. &ldquo;Mistress
      Ogilvie said it wasn&rsquo;t any more good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When Mistress Ogilvie made that remark,&rdquo; replied the Reverend Ronald,
      &ldquo;she had no idea that it would ever touch the shoulders of the martyred
      Sir Patrick Spens. Now, I happen to love&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Francesca hung out a scarlet flag in each cheek, and I was about to say,
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t mind me!&rsquo; when he continued&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I was saying, I happen to love &lsquo;Sir Patrick Spens,&rsquo;&mdash;it is my
      favourite ballad; so, with your permission, I will take the gown, and you
      can find something less valuable for a sail!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could never understand just why Francesca was so annoyed at being
      discovered in our innocent game. Of course she was prone on Mother Earth
      and her tresses were much dishevelled, but she looked lovely after all, in
      comparison with me, the humble &lsquo;supe&rsquo; and lightning-change artist; yet I
      kept my temper,&mdash;at least I kept it until the Reverend Ronald
      observed, after escorting us through the gap in the wall, &ldquo;By the way,
      Miss Hamilton, there was a gentleman from Paris at your cottage, and he is
      walking down the road to meet you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Walking down the road to meet me, forsooth! Have ministers no brains? The
      Reverend Mr. Macdonald had wasted five good minutes with his observations,
      introductions, explanations, felicitations, and adorations, and meantime,
      regardez-moi, messieurs et mesdames, s&rsquo;il vous plait! I have been a
      Noroway dog, a shipbuilder, and a gallant sailorman; I have been a gurly
      sea and a towering gale; I have crawled from beneath broken anchors,
      topsails, and mizzenmasts to a strand where I have been a suffering lady
      plying a gowd kaim. My skirt of blue drill has been twisted about my
      person until it trails in front; my collar is wilted, my cravat untied; I
      have lost a stud and a sleeve-link; my hair is in a tangled mass, my face
      is scarlet and dusty&mdash;and a gentleman from Paris is walking down the
      road to meet me!

      Chapter XVIII. Paris comes to Pettybaw.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;There were three ladies in a hall&mdash;
     With a heigh-ho! and a lily gay,
   There came a lord among them all&mdash;
     As the primrose spreads so sweetly.&rsquo; 

    &mdash;The Cruel Brother.
</pre>
    <p>
      Willie Beresford has come to Pettybaw, and that Arcadian village has
      received the last touch that makes it Paradise.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are exploring the neighbourhood together, and whichever path we take we
      think it lovelier than the one before. This morning we drove to Pettybaw
      Sands, Francesca and Salemina following by the footpath and meeting us on
      the shore. It is all so enchantingly fresh and green on one of these rare
      bright days: the trig lass bleaching her &lsquo;claes&rsquo; on the grass by the burn
      near the little stone bridge; the wild partridges whirring about in pairs;
      the farm-boy seated on the clean straw in the bottom of his cart, and
      cracking his whip in mere wanton joy at the sunshine; the pretty cottages;
      and the gardens with rows of currant and gooseberry bushes hanging thick
      with fruit that suggests jam and tart in every delicious globule. It is a
      love-coloured landscape, we know it full well; and nothing in the fair
      world about us is half as beautiful as what we see in each other&rsquo;s eyes.
      Ah, the memories of these first golden mornings together after our long
      separation. I shall sprinkle them with lavender and lay them away in that
      dim chamber of the heart where we keep precious things. We all know the
      chamber. It is fragrant with other hidden treasures, for all of them are
      sweet, though some are sad. That is the reason why we put a finger on the
      lip and say &lsquo;Hush,&rsquo; if we open the door and allow any one to peep in.
    </p>
    <p>
      We tied the pony by the wayside and alighted: Willie to gather some sprays
      of the pink veronica and blue speedwell, I to sit on an old bench and
      watch him in happy idleness. The &lsquo;white-blossomed slaes&rsquo; sweetened the
      air, and the distant hills were gay with golden whin and broom, or flushed
      with the purply-red of the bell heather.
    </p>
    <p>
      We heard the note of the cushats from a neighbouring bush. They used to
      build their nests on the ground, so the story goes, but the cows trampled
      them. Now they are wiser and build higher, and their cry is supposed to be
      a derisive one, directed to their ancient enemies. &lsquo;Come noo, Coo, Coo!
      Come noo!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A hedgehog crept stealthily along the ground, and at a sudden sound curled
      himself up like a wee brown bear. There were women working in the fields
      near by,&mdash;a strange sight to our eyes at first, but nothing unusual
      here, where many of them are employed on the farms all the year round,
      sowing weeding, planting, even ploughing in the spring, and in winter
      working at threshing or in the granary.
    </p>
    <p>
      An old man, leaning on his staff, came tottering feebly along, and sank
      down on the bench beside me. He was dirty, ragged, unkempt, and feeble,
      but quite sober, and pathetically anxious for human sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m achty-sax year auld,&rsquo; he maundered, apropos of nothing, &ldquo;achty-sax
      year auld. I&rsquo;ve seen five lairds o&rsquo; Pettybaw, sax placed meenisters, an&rsquo; 
      seeven doctors. I was a mason, an&rsquo; a stoot mon i&rsquo; thae days, but it&rsquo;s a
      meeserable life noo. Wife deid, bairns deid! I sit by my lane, an&rsquo; smoke
      my pipe, wi&rsquo; naebody to gi&rsquo;e me a sup o&rsquo; water. Achty-sax is ower auld for
      a mon,&mdash;ower auld.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These are the sharp contrasts of life one cannot bear to face when one is
      young and happy. Willie gave him a half-crown and some tobacco for his
      pipe, and when the pony trotted off briskly, and we left the shrunken
      figure alone on his bench as he was lonely in his life, we kissed each
      other and pledged ourselves to look after him as long as we remain in
      Pettybaw; for what is love worth if it does not kindle the flames of
      spirit, open the gates of feeling, and widen the heart to shelter all the
      little loves and great loves that crave admittance?
    </p>
    <p>
      As we neared the tiny fishing-village on the sands we met a fishwife brave
      in her short skirt and eight petticoats, the basket with its two hundred
      pound weight on her head, and the auld wife herself knitting placidly as
      she walked along. They look superbly strong, these women; but, to be sure,
      the &lsquo;weak anes dee,&rsquo; as one of them told me.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an air of bustle about the little quay,&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;That joyfu&rsquo; din when the boats come in,
     When the boats come in sae early;
   When the lift is blue an&rsquo; the herring-nets fu&rsquo;,
     And the sun glints in a&rsquo; things rarely.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      The silvery shoals of fish no longer come so near the shore as they used
      in the olden time, for then the kirk bell of St. Monan&rsquo;s had its tongue
      tied when the &lsquo;draive&rsquo; was off the coast, lest its knell should frighten
      away the shining myriads of the deep.
    </p>
    <p>
      We climbed the shoulder of a great green cliff until we could sit on the
      rugged rocks at the top and overlook the sea. The bluff is well named
      Nirly Scaur, and a wild desolate spot it is, with grey lichen-clad
      boulders and stunted heather on its summit. In a storm here, the wind
      buffets and slashes and scourges one like invisible whips, and below the
      sea churns itself into foaming waves, driving its &lsquo;infinite squadrons of
      wild white horses&rsquo; eternally toward the shore. It was calm and blue
      to-day, and no sound disturbed the quiet save the incessant shriek and
      scream of the rock birds, the kittiwakes, black-headed gulls, and
      guillemots that live on the sides of these high sheer craigs. Here the
      mother guillemot lays her single egg, and here, on these narrow shelves of
      precipitous rock, she holds it in place with her foot until the warmth of
      her leg and overhanging body hatches it into life, when she takes it on
      her back and flies down to the sea. Motherhood under difficulties, it
      would seem, and the education of the baby guillemot is carried forward on
      Spartan principles; for the moment he is out of the shell he is swept
      downward hundreds of feet and plunged into a cold ocean, where he can sink
      or swim as instinct serves him. In a life so fraught with anxieties,
      exposures, and dangers, it is not strange that the guillemots keeps up a
      ceaseless clang of excited conversation, a very riot and wrangle of
      altercation and argument which the circumstances seem to warrant. The
      prospective father is obliged to take turns with the prospective mother,
      and hold the one precious egg on the rock while she goes for a fly, a
      swim, a bite, and a sup. As there are five hundred other parents on the
      same rock, and the eggs look to be only a couple of inches apart, the
      scene must be distracting, and I have no doubt we should find, if
      statistics were gathered, that thousands of guillemots die of nervous
      prostration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Willie and I interpreted the clamour somewhat as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      [Between parent birds.]
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to take my foot off. Are you ready to put yours on? Don&rsquo;t be
      clumsy! Wait a minute, I&rsquo;m not ready. I&rsquo;M NOT READY, I TELL YOU! NOW!!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      [Between rival mothers.]
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your egg is so close to mine that I can&rsquo;t breathe&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Move your egg, then, I can&rsquo;t move mine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re sitting so close, I can&rsquo;t stretch my wings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither can I. You&rsquo;ve got as much room as I have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall tumble if you crowd me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go ahead and tumble, then! There is plenty of room in the sea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      [From one father to another ceremoniously.]
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, but I&rsquo;m afraid I shoved your wife off the rock last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it. I remember I shoved off your wife&rsquo;s mother last year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We walked among the tiny whitewashed low-roofed cots, each with its
      silver-skinned fishes tacked invitingly against the door-frame to dry,
      until we came to my favourite, the corner cottage in the row. It has
      beautiful narrow garden strips in front,&mdash;solid patches of colour in
      sweet gillyflower bushes, from which the kindly housewife plucked a
      nosegay for us. Her white columbines she calls &lsquo;granny&rsquo;s mutches&rsquo;; and
      indeed they are not unlike those fresh white caps. Dear Robbie Burns, ten
      inches high in plaster, stands in the sunny window in a tiny box of
      blossoming plants surrounded by a miniature green picket fence. Outside,
      looming white among the gillyflowers, is Sir Walter, and near him is still
      another and a larger bust on a cracked pedestal a foot high, perhaps. We
      did not recognise the head at once, and asked the little woman who it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Homer, the graund Greek poet,&rdquo; she answered cheerily; &ldquo;an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m to have
      anither o&rsquo; Burns, as tall as Homer, when my daughter comes hame frae
      E&rsquo;nbro&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If the shade of Homer keeps account of his earthly triumphs, I think he is
      proud of his place in that humble Scotchwoman&rsquo;s gillyflower garden, with
      his head under the drooping petals of granny&rsquo;s white mutches.
    </p>
    <p>
      What do you think her &lsquo;mon&rsquo; is called in the village! John o&rsquo; Mary! But he
      is not alone in his meekness, for there are Jock o&rsquo; Meg, Willie o&rsquo; Janet,
      Jem o&rsquo; Tibby, and a dozen others. These primitive fishing-villages are the
      places where all the advanced women ought to congregate, for the wife is
      head of the house; the accountant, the treasurer, the auditor, the
      chancellor of the exchequer; and though her husband does catch the fish
      for her to sell, that is accounted apparently as a detail too trivial for
      notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we passed Mary&rsquo;s cottage on our way to the sands next day, Burns&rsquo;s
      head had been accidentally broken off by the children, and we felt as
      though we had lost a friend; but Scotch thrift, and loyalty to the dear
      Ploughman Poet, came to the rescue, and when we returned, Robert&rsquo;s plaster
      head had been glued to his body. He smiled at us again from between the
      two scarlet geraniums, and a tendril of ivy had been gently curled about
      his neck to hide the cruel wound.
    </p>
    <p>
      After such long, lovely mornings as this, there is a late luncheon under
      the shadow of a rock with Salemina and Francesca, an idle chat, or the
      chapter of a book, and presently Lady Ardmore and her daughter Elizabeth
      drive down to the sands. They are followed by Robin Anstruther, Jamie, and
      Ralph on bicycles, and before long the stalwart figure of Ronald Macdonald
      appears in the distance, just in time for a cup of tea, which we brew in
      Lady Ardmore&rsquo;s bath-house on the beach.

      The Cotter&rsquo;s Saturday Night.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have lived in Pettybaw a very short time, but I see that we have
      already made an impression upon all grades of society. This was not our
      intention. We gave Edinburgh as our last place of residence, with the view
      of concealing our nationality, until such time as we should choose to
      declare it; that is, when public excitement with regard to our rental of
      the house in the loaning should have lapsed into a state of indifference.
      And yet, modest, economical, and commonplace as has been the
      administration of our affairs, our method of life has evidently been
      thought unusual, and our conduct not precisely the conduct of other summer
      visitors. Even our daily purchases, in manner, in number, and in
      character, seem to be looked upon as eccentric, for whenever we leave a
      shop, the relatives of the greengrocer, flesher, draper, whoever it may
      be, bound downstairs, surround him in an eager circle, and inquire the
      latest news.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an unwise moment we begged the draper&rsquo;s wife to honour us with a visit
      and explain the obliquities of the kitchen range and the tortuosities of
      the sink-spout to Miss Grieve. While our landlady was on the premises, I
      took occasion to invite her up to my own room, with a view of seeing
      whether my mattress of pebbles and iron-filings could be supplemented by
      another of shavings or straw, or some material less provocative of bodily
      injuries. She was most sympathetic, persuasive, logical and after the
      manner of her kind proved to me conclusively that the trouble lay with the
      too-saft occupant of the bed, not with the bed itself, and gave me
      statistics with regard to the latter which established its reputation and
      at the same moment destroyed my own.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked in at the various doors casually as she passed up and down the
      stairs,&mdash;all save that of the dining-room, which Francesca had
      prudently locked to conceal the fact that we had covered the family
      portraits,&mdash;and I noticed at the time that her face wore an
      expression of mingled grief and astonishment. It seemed to us afterward
      that there was a good deal more passing up and down the loaning than when
      we first arrived. At dusk especially, small processions of children and
      young people walked by our cottage and gave shy glances at the windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding Miss Grieve in an unusually amiable mood, I inquired the probable
      cause of this phenomenon. She would not go so far as to give any judicial
      opinion, but offered a few conjectures.
    </p>
    <p>
      It might be the tirling-pin; it might be the white satin ribbons on the
      curtains; it might be the guitars and banjos; it might be the bicycle
      crate; it might be the profusion of plants; it might be the continual
      feasting and revelry; it might be the blazing fires in a Pettybaw summer.
      She thought a much more likely reason, however, was because it had become
      known in the village that we had moved every stick of furniture in the
      house out of its accustomed place and taken the dressing-tables away from
      the windows,&mdash;&lsquo;the windys,&rsquo; she called them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I discussed this matter fully with Mr. Macdonald later on. He laughed
      heartily, but confessed, with an amused relish of his national
      conservatism, that to his mind there certainly was something radical,
      advanced, and courageous in taking a dressing-table away from its place,
      back to the window, and putting it anywhere else in a room. He would be
      frank, he said, and acknowledge that it suggested an undisciplined and
      lawless habit of thought, a disregard for authority, a lack of reverence
      for tradition, and a riotous and unbridled imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      This view of the matter gave us exquisite enjoyment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why?&rdquo; I asked laughingly. &ldquo;The dressing-table is not a sacred object,
      even to a woman. Why treat it with such veneration? Where there is but one
      good light, and that immediately in front of the window, there is every
      excuse for the British custom, but when the light is well diffused, why
      not place the table where-ever it looks well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but it doesn&rsquo;t look well anywhere but back to the window,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Macdonald artlessly. &ldquo;It belongs there, you see; it has probably been
      there since the time of Malcolm Canmore, unless Margaret was too pious to
      look in a mirror. With your national love of change, you cannot conceive
      how soothing it is to know that whenever you enter your gate and glance
      upward, you will always see the curtains parted, and between them, like an
      idol in a shrine, the ugly wooden back of a little oval or oblong
      looking-glass. It gives one a sense of permanence in a world where all is
      fleeting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The public interest in our doings seems to be entirely of a friendly
      nature, and if our neighbours find a hundredth part of the charm and
      novelty in us that we find in them, they are fortunate indeed, and we
      cheerfully sacrifice our privacy on the altar of the public good.

      A village in Scotland is the only place I can fancy where housekeeping
      becomes an enthralling occupation. All drudgery disappears in a rosy glow
      of unexpected, unique, and stimulating conditions. I would rather
      superintend Miss Grieve, and cause the light of amazement to gleam ten
      times daily in her humid eye, than lead a cotillion with Willie Beresford.
      I would rather do the marketing for our humble breakfasts and teas, or
      talk over the day&rsquo;s luncheons and dinners with Mistress Brodie of the
      Pettybaw Inn and Posting Establishment, than go to the opera.
    </p>
    <p>
      Salemina and Francesca do not enjoy it all quite as intensely as I, so
      they considerately give me the lion&rsquo;s share. Every morning, after an
      exhilarating interview with the Niobe of our kitchen (who thinks me
      irresponsible, and prays Heaven in her heart I be no worse), I put on my
      goloshes, take my umbrella, and trudge up and down the little streets and
      lanes on real and, if need be, imaginary errands. The Duke of Wellington
      said, &lsquo;When fair in Scotland, always carry an umbrella; when it rains,
      please yourself,&rsquo; and I sometimes agree with Stevenson&rsquo;s shivering
      statement, &lsquo;Life does not seem to me to be an amusement adapted to this
      climate.&rsquo; I quoted this to the doctor yesterday, but he remarked with some
      surprise that he had not missed a day&rsquo;s golfing for weeks. The chemist
      observed as he handed me a cake of soap, &lsquo;Won&rsquo;erful blest in weather, we
      are, mam,&rsquo; simply because, the rain being unaccompanied with high wind,
      one was enabled to hold up an umbrella without having it turned inside
      out. When it ceased dripping for an hour at noon, the greengrocer said
      cheerily, &lsquo;Another grand day, mam!&rsquo; I assented, though I could not for the
      life of me remember when the last one occurred. However, dreary as the
      weather may be, one cannot be dull when doing one&rsquo;s morning round of
      shopping in Pettybaw or Strathdee. I have only to give you thumb-nail
      sketches of our favourite tradespeople to convince you of that fact.

      We bought our first groceries of Mrs. Robert Phin, of Strathdee, simply
      because she is an inimitable conversationalist. She is expansive, too,
      about family matters, and tells us certain of her &lsquo;mon&rsquo;s&rsquo; faults which it
      would be more seemly to keep in the safe shelter of her own bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rab takes a wee drappie too much, it appears, and takes it so often that
      he has little time to earn an honest penny for his family. This is bad
      enough; but the fact that Mrs. Phin has been twice wed before, and that in
      each case she innocently chose a ne&rsquo;er-do-weel for a mate, makes her a
      trifle cynical. She told me that she had laid twa husbands in the
      kirk-yard near which her little shop stands, and added cheerfully, as I
      made some sympathetic response, &lsquo;An&rsquo; I hope it&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; be lang afore I box
      Rab!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Salemina objects to the shop because it is so disorderly. Soap and sugar,
      tea and bloaters, starch and gingham, lead pencils and sausages, lie side
      by side cosily. Boxes of pins are kept on top of kegs of herrings. Tins of
      coffee are distributed impartially anywhere and everywhere, and the bacon
      sometimes reposes in a glass case with small-wares and findings, out of
      the reach of Alexander&rsquo;s dogs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexander is one of a brood, or perhaps I should say three broods, of
      children which wander among the barrels and boxes and hams and winceys
      seeking what they may devour,&mdash;a handful of sugar, a prune, or a
      sweetie.
    </p>
    <p>
      We often see the bairns at their luncheon or dinner in a little room just
      off the shop, Alexander the Small always sitting or kneeling on a
      &lsquo;creepie,&rsquo; holding his plate down firmly with the left hand and eating
      with the right, whether the food be fish, porridge, or broth. In the Phin
      family the person who does not hold his plate down runs the risk of losing
      it to one of the other children or to the dogs, who, with eager eye and
      reminding paw, gather round the hospitable board, licking their chops
      hopefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy these scenes very much, but, alas! I can no longer witness them as
      often as formerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      This morning Mrs. Phin greeted me with some embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe ye&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; ken me,&rdquo; she said, her usually clear speech a little
      blurred. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the teeth. I&rsquo;ve mislaid &lsquo;em somewhere. I paid far too much
      siller for &lsquo;em to wear &lsquo;em ilka day. Sometimes I rest &lsquo;em in the teabox to
      keep &lsquo;em awa&rsquo; frae the bairns, but I canna find &lsquo;em theer. I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo; 
      maybe they&rsquo;ll be in the rice, but I&rsquo;ve been ower thrang to luik!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This anecdote was too rich to keep to myself, but its unconscious humour
      made no impression upon Salemina, who insisted upon the withdrawal of our
      patronage. I have tried to persuade her that, whatever may be said of tea
      and rice, we run no risk in buying eggs; but she is relentless.
    </p>

    <p>
      The kirkyard where Rab&rsquo;s two predecessors have been laid, and where Rab
      will lie when Mrs. Phin has &lsquo;boxed&rsquo; him, is a sleepy little place set on a
      gentle slope of ground, softly shaded by willow and yew trees. It is
      enclosed by a stone wall, into which an occasional ancient tombstone is
      built, its name and date almost obliterated by stress of time and weather.
    </p>
    <p>
      We often walk through its quiet, myrtle-bordered paths on our way to the
      other end of the village, where Mrs. Bruce, the flesher, keeps an
      unrivalled assortment of beef and mutton. The headstones, many of them
      laid flat upon the graves, are interesting to us because of their quaint
      inscriptions, in which the occupation of the deceased is often stated with
      modest pride and candour. One expects to see the achievements of the
      soldier, the sailor, or the statesman carved in the stone that marks his
      resting-place, but to our eyes it is strange enough to read that the
      subject of eulogy was a plumber, tobacconist, maker of golf-balls, or a
      golf champion; in which latter case there is a spirited etching or
      bas-relief of the dead hero, with knickerbockers, cap, and clubs complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, too, lies Thomas Loughead, Hairdresser, a profession far too little
      celebrated in song and story. His stone is a simple one, and bears merely
      the touching tribute:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   He was lovely and pleasant in his life,
</pre>
    <p>
      the inference being, to one who knows a line of Scripture, that in his
      death he was not divided.
    </p>
    <p>
      These kirkyard personalities almost lead one to believe in the
      authenticity of the British tradesman&rsquo;s epitaph, wherein his
      practical-minded relict stated that the &lsquo;bereaved widow would continue to
      carry on the tripe and trotter business at the old stand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      .    .    .    .
</pre>
    <p>
      One day when we were walking through the little village of Strathdee we
      turned the corner of a quiet side street and came suddenly upon something
      altogether strange and unexpected.
    </p>
    <p>
      A stone cottage of the everyday sort stood a trifle back from the road and
      bore over its front door a sign announcing that Mrs. Bruce, Flesher,
      carried on her business within; and indeed one could look through the
      windows and see ruddy joints hanging from beams, and piles of
      pink-and-white steaks and chops lying neatly on the counter, crying,
      &lsquo;Come, eat me!&rsquo; Nevertheless, one&rsquo;s first glance would be arrested neither
      by Mrs Bruce&rsquo;s black-and-gold sign, nor by the enticements of her
      stock-in-trade, because one&rsquo;s attention is rapped squarely between the
      eyes by an astonishing shape that arises from the patch of lawn in front
      of the cottage, and completely dominates the scene. Imagine yourself face
      to face with the last thing you would expect to see in a modest front
      dooryard,&mdash;the figurehead of a ship, heroic in size, gorgeous in
      colour, majestic in pose! A female personage it appears to be from the
      drapery, which is the only key the artist furnishes as to sex, and a
      queenly female withal, for she wears a crown at least a foot high, and
      brandishes a forbidding sceptre. All this seen from the front, but the
      rear view discloses the fact that the lady terminates in the tail of a
      fish which wriggles artistically in mid-air and is of a brittle sort, as
      it has evidently been thrice broken and glued together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Bruce did not leave us long in suspense, but obligingly came out,
      partly to comment on the low price of mutton and partly to tell the tale
      of the mammoth mermaid. By rights, of course, Mrs. Bruce&rsquo;s husband should
      have been the gallant captain of a bark which foundered at sea and sent
      every man to his grave on the ocean-bed. The ship&rsquo;s figurehead should have
      been discovered by some miracle, brought to the sorrowing widow, and set
      up in the garden in eternal remembrance of the dear departed. This was the
      story in my mind, but as a matter of fact the rude effigy was wrought by
      Mrs. Bruce&rsquo;s father for a ship to be called the Sea Queen, but by some
      mischance, ship and figurehead never came together, and the old
      wood-carver left it to his daughter, in lieu of other property. It has not
      been wholly unproductive, Mrs. Bruce fancies, for the casual passers-by,
      like those who came to scoff and remained to pray, go into the shop to ask
      questions about the Sea Queen and buy chops out of courtesy and gratitude.
    </p>

    <p>
      On our way to the bakery, which is a daily walk with us, we always glance
      at a little cot in a grassy lane just off the fore street. In one half of
      this humble dwelling Mrs. Davidson keeps a slender stock of shop-worn
      articles,&mdash;pins, needles, threads, sealing-wax, pencils, and sweeties
      for the children, all disposed attractively upon a single shelf behind the
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Across the passage, close to the other window, sits day after day an old
      woman of eight-six summers who has lost her kinship with the present and
      gone back to dwell for ever in the past. A small table stands in front of
      her rush-bottomed chair, the old family Bible rests upon it, and in front
      of the Bible are always four tiny dolls, with which the trembling old
      fingers play from morning till night. They are cheap, common little
      puppets, but she robes and disrobes them with tenderest care. They are put
      to bed upon the Bible, take their walks along its time-worn pages, are
      married on it, buried on it, and the direst punishment they ever receive
      is to be removed from its sacred covers and temporarily hidden beneath the
      dear old soul&rsquo;s black alpaca apron. She is quite happy with her treasures
      on week-days; but on Sundays&mdash;alas and alas! the poor old dame sits
      in her lonely chair with the furtive tears dropping on her wrinkled
      cheeks, for it is a God-fearing household, and it is neither lawful nor
      seemly to play with dolls on the Sawbath!
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      .    .    .    .
</pre>
    <p>
      Mrs. Nicolson is the presiding genius of the bakery, she is more&mdash;she
      is the bakery itself. A Mr. Nicolson there is, and he is known to be the
      baker, but he dwells in the regions below the shop and only issues at rare
      intervals, beneath the friendly shelter of a huge tin tray filled with
      scones and baps.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you saw Mrs. Nicolson&rsquo;s kitchen with the firelight gleaming on its
      bright copper, its polished candlesticks, and its snowy floor, you would
      think her an admirable housewife, but you would get no clue to those
      shrewd and masterful traits of character which reveal themselves chiefly
      behind the counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Grieve had purchased of Mrs. Nicolson a quarter section of very
      appetising ginger-cake to eat with our afternoon tea, and I stepped in to
      buy more. She showed me a large round loaf for two shillings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I objected, &ldquo;I cannot use a whole loaf, thank you. We eat very
      little at a time, and like it perfectly fresh. I wish a small piece such
      as my maid bought the other day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then ensued a discourse which I cannot render in the vernacular, more&rsquo;s
      the pity, though I understood it all too well for my comfort. The
      substance of it was this: that she couldna and wouldna tak&rsquo; it in hand to
      give me a quarter section of cake when the other three-quarters might gae
      dry in the bakery; that the reason she sold the small piece on the former
      occasion was that her daughter, her son-in-law, and their three children
      came from Ballahoolish to visit her, and she gave them a high tea with no
      expense spared; that at this function they devoured three-fourths of a
      ginger-cake, and just as she was mournfully regarding the remainder my
      servant came in and took it off her hands; that she had kept a bakery for
      thirty years and her mother before her, and never had a two-shilling
      ginger-cake been sold in pieces before, nor was it likely ever to occur
      again; that if I, under Providence, so to speak, had been the fortunate
      gainer by the transaction, why not eat my six penny-worth in solemn
      gratitude once for all, and not expect a like miracle to happen the next
      week? And finally, that two-shilling ginger-cakes were, in the very nature
      of things, designed for large families; and it was the part of wisdom for
      small families to fix their affections on something else, for she couldna
      and wouldna tak&rsquo; it in hand to cut a rare and expensive article for a
      small customer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The torrent of logic was over, and I said humbly that I would take the
      whole loaf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Verra weel, mam,&rdquo; she responded more affably, &ldquo;thank you kindly; no, I
      couldna tak&rsquo; it in hand to sell six pennyworth of that ginger-cake and let
      one-and-sixpence worth gae dry in the bakery.&mdash;A beautiful day, mam!
      Won&rsquo;erful blest in weather ye are! Let me open your umbrella for you,
      mam!&rdquo;

      David Robb is the weaver of Pettybaw. All day long he sits at his
      old-fashioned hand-loom, which, like the fruit of his toil and the dear
      old greybeard himself, belongs to a day that is past and gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He might have work enough to keep an apprentice busy, but where would he
      find a lad sufficiently behind the times to learn a humble trade now
      banished to the limbo of superseded, almost forgotten things?
    </p>
    <p>
      His home is but a poor place, but the rough room in which he works is big
      enough to hold a deal of sweet content. It is cheery enough, too, to
      attract the Pettybaw weans, who steal in on wet days and sit on the floor
      playing with the thrums, or with bits of coloured ravellings. Sometimes
      when they have proved themselves wise and prudent little virgins, they are
      even allowed to touch the hanks of pink and yellow and blue yarn that lie
      in rainbow-hued confusion on the long deal table.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this time the &lsquo;heddles&rsquo; go up and down, up and down, with their
      ceaseless clatter, and David throws the shuttle back and forth as he
      weaves his old-fashioned winceys.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have grown to be good friends, David and I, and I have been permitted
      the signal honour of painting him at his work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The loom stands by an eastern window, and the rare Pettybaw sunshine
      filters through the branches of a tree, shines upon the dusty
      window-panes, and throws a halo round David&rsquo;s head that he well deserves
      and little suspects. In my foreground sit Meg and Jean and Elspeth playing
      with thrums and wearing the fruit of David&rsquo;s loom in their gingham frocks.
      David himself sits on his wooden bench behind the maze of cords that form
      the &lsquo;loom harness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The snows of seventy winters powder his hair and beard. His spectacles are
      often pushed back on his kindly brow, but no glass could wholly obscure
      the clear integrity and steadfast purity of his eyes; and as for his
      smile, I have not the art to paint that! It holds in solution so many
      sweet though humble virtues of patience, temperance, self-denial, honest
      endeavour, that my brush falters in the attempt to fix the radiant whole
      upon the canvas. Fashions come and go, modern improvements transform the
      arts and trades, manual skill gives way to the cunning of the machine, but
      old David Robb, after more than fifty years of toil, still sits at his
      hand-loom and weaves his winceys for the Pettybaw bairnies.
    </p>
    <p>
      David has small book-learning, so he tells me; and indeed he had need to
      tell me, for I should never have discovered it myself,&mdash;one misses it
      so little when the larger things are all present!
    </p>
    <p>
      A certain summer visitor in Pettybaw (a compatriot of ours, by the way)
      bought a quantity of David&rsquo;s orange-coloured wincey, and finding that it
      wore like iron, wished to order more. She used the word &lsquo;reproduce&rsquo; in her
      telegram, as there was one pattern and one colour she specially liked.
      Perhaps the context was not illuminating, but at any rate the word
      &lsquo;reproduce&rsquo; was not in David&rsquo;s vocabulary, and putting back his spectacles
      he told me his difficulty in deciphering the exact meaning of his
      fine-lady patron. He called at the Free Kirk manse,&mdash;the meenister
      was no&rsquo; at hame; then to the library,&mdash;it was closed; then to the
      Estaiblished manse,&mdash;the meenister was awa&rsquo;. At last he obtained a
      glance at the schoolmaster&rsquo;s dictionary, and turning to &lsquo;reproduce&rsquo; found
      that it meant &lsquo;nought but mak&rsquo; ower again&rsquo;;&mdash;and with an amused smile
      at the bedevilments of language he turned once more to his loom and I to
      my canvas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding his unfamiliarity with &lsquo;langnebbit&rsquo; words, David has
      absorbed a deal of wisdom in his quiet life; though so far as I can see,
      his only books have been the green tree outside his window, a glimpse of
      the distant ocean, and the toil of his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I sometimes question if as many scholars are not made as marred in
      this wise, for&mdash;to the seeing eye&mdash;the waving leaf and the far
      sea, the daily task, one&rsquo;s own heart-beats, and one&rsquo;s neighbour&rsquo;s,&mdash;these
      teach us in good time to interpret Nature&rsquo;s secrets, and man&rsquo;s, and God&rsquo;s
      as well.

      Tea at Rowardennan Castle is an impressive and a delightful function. It
      is served by a ministerial-looking butler and a just-ready-to-be-ordained
      footman. They both look as if they had been nourished on the Thirty-Nine
      Articles, but they know their business as well as if they had been trained
      in heathen lands,&mdash;which is saying a good deal, for everybody knows
      that heathen servants wait upon one with idolatrous solicitude. However,
      from the quality of the cheering beverage itself down to the thickness of
      the cream, the thinness of the china, the crispness of the toast, and the
      plummyness of the cake, tea at Rowardennan Castle is perfect in every
      detail.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scones are of unusual lightness, also. I should think they would
      scarcely weigh more than four, perhaps even five, to a pound; but I am
      aware that the casual traveller, who eats only at hotels, and never has
      the privilege of entering feudal castles, will be slow to believe this
      estimate, particularly just after breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Salemina always describes a Scotch scone as an aspiring but unsuccessful
      soda-biscuit of the New England sort. Stevenson, in writing of that dense
      black substance, inimical to life, called Scotch bun, says that the
      patriotism that leads a Scotsman to eat it will hardly desert him in any
      emergency. Salemina thinks that the scone should be bracketed with the bun
      (in description, of course, never in the human stomach), and says that, as
      a matter of fact, &lsquo;th&rsquo; unconquer&rsquo;d Scot&rsquo; of old was not only clad in a
      shirt of mail, but well fortified within when he went forth to warfare
      after a meal of oatmeal and scones. She insists that the spear which would
      pierce the shirt of mail would be turned aside and blunted by the ordinary
      scone of commerce; but what signifies the opinion of a woman who eats
      sugar on her porridge?
    </p>
    <p>
      Considering the air of liberal hospitality that hangs about the castle
      tea-table, I wonder that our friends do not oftener avail themselves of
      its privileges and allow us to do so; but on all dark, foggy, or inclement
      days, or whenever they tire of the sands, everybody persists in taking tea
      at Bide-a-Wee Cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      We buy our tea of the Pettybaw grocer, some of our cups are cracked, the
      teapot is of earthenware, Miss Grieve disapproves of all social
      tea-fuddles, and shows it plainly when she brings in the tray, and the
      room is so small that some of us overflow into the hall or the garden; it
      matters not; there is some fatal charm in our humble hospitality. At four
      o&rsquo;clock one of us is obliged to be, like Sister Anne, on the housetop; and
      if company approaches, she must descend and speed to the plumber&rsquo;s for six
      pennyworth extra of cream. In most well-ordered British households Miss
      Grieve would be requested to do this speeding, but both her mind and her
      body move too slowly for such domestic crises; and then, too, her temper
      has to be kept as unruffled as possible, so that she will cut the bread
      and butter thin. This she generally does if she has not been &lsquo;fair
      doun-hadden wi&rsquo; wark&rsquo;; but the washing of her own spinster cup and plate,
      together with the incident sighs and groans, occupies her till so late an
      hour that she is not always dressed for callers.

      Willie and I were reading The Lady of the Lake the other day, in the back
      garden, surrounded by the verdant leafage of our own kale-yard. It is a
      pretty spot when the sun shines, a trifle domestic in its air, perhaps,
      but restful: Miss Grieve&rsquo;s dish-towels and aprons drying on the currant
      bushes, the cat playing with a mutton-bone or a fish-tail on the grass,
      and the little birds perching on the rims of our wash-boiler and
      water-buckets. It can be reached only by way of the kitchen, which
      somewhat lessens its value as a pleasure-ground or a rustic retreat, but
      Willie and I retire there now and then for a quiet chat.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this particular occasion Willie was declaiming the exciting verses
      where Fitz-James and Murdoch are crossing the stream
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;That joins Loch Katrine to Achray,&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      where the crazed Blanche of Devan first appears:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;All in the Trosachs&rsquo; glen was still,
   Noontide was sleeping on the hill:
   Sudden his guide whoop&rsquo;d loud and high&mdash;
   &ldquo;Murdoch! was that a signal cry?&rdquo;&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was indeed,&rdquo; said Francesca, appearing suddenly at an upper window
      overhanging the garden. &ldquo;Pardon this intrusion, but the Castle people are
      here,&rdquo; she continued in what is known as a stage whisper,&mdash;that is,
      one that can be easily heard by a thousand persons,&mdash;&ldquo;the Castle
      people and the ladies from Pettybaw House; and Mr. Macdonald is coming
      down the loaning; but Calamity Jane is making her toilet in the kitchen,
      and you cannot take Mr. Beresford through into the sitting-room at
      present. She says this hoose has so few conveniences that it&rsquo;s &lsquo;fair
      sickenin&rsquo;.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long will she be?&rdquo; queried Mr. Beresford anxiously, putting The Lady
      of the Lake in his pocket, and pacing up and down between the rows of
      cabbages.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has just begun. Whatever you do, don&rsquo;t unsettle her temper, for she
      will have to prepare for eight to-day. I will send Mr. Macdonald and Miss
      Macrae to the bakery for gingerbread, to gain time, and possibly I can
      think of a way to rescue you. If I can&rsquo;t, are you tolerably comfortable?
      Perhaps Miss Grieve won&rsquo;t mind Penelope, and she can come through the
      kitchen any time and join us; but naturally you don&rsquo;t want to be
      separated, that&rsquo;s the worst of being engaged. Of course I can lower your
      tea in a tin bucket, and if it should rain I can throw out umbrellas.
      Would you like your golf-caps, Pen? &lsquo;Won&rsquo;erful blest in weather ye are,
      mam!&rsquo; The situation is not so bad as it might be,&rdquo; she added consolingly,
      &ldquo;because in case Miss Grieve&rsquo;s toilet should last longer than usual, your
      wedding need not be indefinitely postponed, for Mr. Macdonald can marry
      you from this window.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here she disappeared, and we had scarcely time to take in the full humour
      of the affair before Robin Anstruther&rsquo;s laughing eyes appeared over the
      top of the high brick wall that protects our garden on three sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not shoot,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I am not come to steal the fruit, but to succour
      humanity in distress. Miss Monroe insisted that I should borrow the inn
      ladder. She thought a rescue would be much more romantic than waiting for
      Miss Grieve. Everybody is coming out to witness it, at least all your
      guests,&mdash;there are no strangers present,&mdash;and Miss Monroe is
      already collecting sixpence a head for the entertainment, to be given, she
      says, for your dear Friar&rsquo;s sustenation fund.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was now astride of the wall, and speedily lifted the ladder to our
      side, where it leaned comfortably against the stout branches of the
      draper&rsquo;s peach vine. Willie ran nimbly up the ladder and bestrode the
      wall. I followed, first standing, and then decorously sitting down on the
      top of it. Mr. Anstruther pulled up the ladder, and replaced it on the
      side of liberty; then he descended, then Willie, and I last of all, amidst
      the acclamations of the onlookers, a select company of six or eight
      persons.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Miss Grieve formally entered the sitting-room bearing the tea-tray,
      she was buskit braw in black stuff gown, clean apron, and fresh cap
      trimmed with purple ribbons, under which her white locks were neatly
      dressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She deplored the coolness of the tea, but accounted for it to me in an
      aside by the sickening quality of Mrs. Sinkler&rsquo;s coals and Mr. Macbrose&rsquo;s
      kindling-wood, to say nothing of the insulting draft in the draper&rsquo;s
      range. When she left the room, I suppose she was unable to explain the
      peals of laughter that rang through our circumscribed halls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Ardmore insists that the rescue was the most unique episode she ever
      witnessed, and says that she never understood America until she made our
      acquaintance. I persuaded her that this was fallacious reasoning; that
      while she might understand us by knowing America, she could not possibly
      reverse this mental operation and be sure of the result. The ladies of
      Pettybaw House said that the occurrence was as Fifish as anything that
      ever happened in Fife. The kingdom of Fife is noted, it seems, for its
      &lsquo;doocots [dovecots] and its daft lairds,&rsquo; and to be eccentric and Fifish
      are one and the same thing. Thereupon Francesca told Mr. Macdonald a story
      she heard in Edinburgh, to the effect that when a certain committee or
      council was quarrelling as to which of certain Fifeshire towns should be
      the seat of a projected lunatic asylum, a new resident arose and suggested
      that the building of a wall round the kingdom of Fife would solve the
      difficulty, settle all disputes, and give sufficient room for the lunatics
      to exercise properly.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the sort of tale that a native can tell with a genial chuckle, but
      it comes with poor grace from an American lady sojourning in Fife.
      Francesca does not mind this, however, as she is at present avenging fresh
      insults to her own beloved country.

    <p>
      The Lady of the Lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Robin Anstruther was telling stories at the tea-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got acquainted with an American girl in rather a queer sort of way,&rdquo; he
      said, between cups. &ldquo;It was in London, on the Duke of York&rsquo;s wedding-day.
      I&rsquo;m rather a tall chap, you see, and in the crowd somebody touched me on
      the shoulder, and a plaintive voice behind me said, &lsquo;You&rsquo;re such a big
      man, and I am so little, will you please help me to save my life? My
      mother was separated from me in the crowd somewhere as we were trying to
      reach the Berkeley, and I don&rsquo;t know what to do.&rsquo; I was a trifle
      nonplussed, but I did the best I could. She was a tiny thing, in a
      marvellous frock and a flowery hat and a silver girdle and chatelaine. In
      another minute she spied a second man, an officer, a full head taller than
      I am, broad shoulders, splendidly put up altogether. Bless me! if she
      didn&rsquo;t turn to him and say, &lsquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re so nice and big, you&rsquo;re even
      bigger than this other gentleman, and I need you both in this dreadful
      crush. If you&rsquo;ll be good enough to stand on either side of me, I shall be
      awfully obliged.&rsquo; We exchanged amused glances of embarrassment over her
      blonde head, but there was no resisting the irresistible. She was a small
      person, but she had the soul of a general, and we obeyed orders. We stood
      guard over her little ladyship for nearly an hour, and I must say she
      entertained us thoroughly, for she was as clever as she was pretty. Then I
      got her a seat in one of the windows of my club, while the other man,
      armed with a full description, went out to hunt up the mother; and, by
      Jove! he found her, too. She would have her mother, and her mother she
      had. They were awfully jolly people; they came to luncheon in my chambers
      at the Albany afterwards, and we grew to be great friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say she was an English girl masquerading,&rdquo; I remarked facetiously.
      &ldquo;What made you think her an American?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, her general appearance and accent, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably she didn&rsquo;t say Barkley,&rdquo; observed Francesca cuttingly; &ldquo;she
      would have been sure to commit that sort of solecism.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you say Barkley in the States?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not; we never call them the States, and with us c-l-e-r-k
      spells clerk, and B-e-r-k Berk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How very odd!&rdquo; remarked Mr. Anstruther.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No odder than you saying Bark, and not half as odd as your calling it
      Albany,&rdquo; I interpolated, to help Francesca.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; said Mr. Anstruther; &ldquo;but how do you say Albany in America?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Penelope and I always call it Allbany,&rdquo; responded Francesca
      nonsensically, &ldquo;but Salemina, who has been much in England, always calls
      it Albany.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This anecdote was the signal for Miss Ardmore to remark (apropos of her
      own discrimination and the American accent) that hearing a lady ask for a
      certain med&rsquo;cine in a chemist&rsquo;s shop, she noted the intonation, and
      inquired of the chemist, when the fair stranger had retired, if she were
      not an American. &ldquo;And she was!&rdquo; exclaimed the Honourable Elizabeth
      triumphantly. &ldquo;And what makes it the more curious, she had been over here
      twenty years, and of course, spoke English quite properly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In avenging fancied insults, it is certainly more just to heap punishment
      on the head of the real offender than upon his neighbour, and it is a
      trifle difficult to decide why Francesca should chastise Mr. Macdonald for
      the good-humoured sins of Mr. Anstruther and Miss Ardmore; yet she does
      so, nevertheless.
    </p>
    <p>
      The history of these chastisements she recounts in the nightly half-hour
      which she spends with me when I am endeavouring to compose myself for
      sleep. Francesca is fluent at all times, but once seated on the foot of my
      bed she becomes eloquent!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It all began with his saying&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This is her perennial introduction, and I respond as invariably, &ldquo;What
      began?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, to-day&rsquo;s argument with Mr. Macdonald. It was a literary quarrel this
      afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Fools rush in&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo; I quoted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a good deal of nonsense in that old saw,&rdquo; she interrupted; &ldquo;at
      all events, the most foolish fools I have ever known stayed still and
      didn&rsquo;t do anything. Rushing shows a certain movement of the mind, even if
      it is in the wrong direction. However, Mr. Macdonald is both opinionated
      and dogmatic, but his worst enemy could never call him a fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t allude to Mr. Macdonald.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you suppose I know to whom you alluded, dear? Is not your style so
      simple, frank, and direct that a wayfaring girl can read it and not err
      therein? No, I am not sitting on your feet, and it is not time to go to
      sleep; I wonder you do not tire of making those futile protests. As a
      matter of fact, we began this literary discussion yesterday morning, but
      were interrupted; and knowing that it was sure to come up again, I
      prepared for it with Salemina. She furnished the ammunition, so to speak,
      and I fired the guns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You always make so much noise with blank cartridges I wonder you ever
      bother about real shot,&rdquo; I remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Penelope, how can you abuse me when I am in trouble? Well, Mr. Macdonald
      was prating, as usual, about the antiquity of Scotland and its aeons of
      stirring history. I am so weary of the venerableness of this country. How
      old will it have to be, I wonder, before it gets used to it? If it&rsquo;s the
      province of art to conceal art, it ought to be the province of age to
      conceal age, and it generally is. &lsquo;Everything doesn&rsquo;t improve with years,&rsquo; 
      I observed sententiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;For instance?&rsquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you know how that question affected me! How I do dislike an
      appetite for specific details! It is simply paralysing to a good
      conversation. Do you remember that silly game in which some one points a
      stick at you and says, &lsquo;Beast, bird, or fish,&mdash;BEAST!&rsquo; and you have
      to name one while he counts ten? If a beast has been requested, you can
      think of one fish and two birds, but no beast. If he says &lsquo;FISH,&rsquo; all the
      beasts in the universe stalk through your memory, but not one finny,
      sealy, swimming thing! Well, that is the effect of &lsquo;For instance?&rsquo; on my
      faculties. So I stumbled a bit, and succeeded in recalling, as objects
      which do not improve with age, mushrooms, women, and chickens, and he was
      obliged to agree with me, which nearly killed him. Then I said that
      although America is so fresh and blooming that people persist in calling
      it young, it is much older than it appears to the superficial eye. There
      is no real propriety in dating us as a nation from the Declaration of
      Independence in 1776, I said, nor even from the landing of the Pilgrims in
      1620; nor, for that matter, from Columbus&rsquo;s discovery in 1492. It&rsquo;s my
      opinion, I asserted, that some of us had been there thousands of years
      before, but nobody had had the sense to discover us. We couldn&rsquo;t discover
      ourselves,&mdash;though if we could have foreseen how the sere and yellow
      nations of the earth would taunt us with youth and inexperience, we should
      have had to do something desperate!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That theory must have been very convincing to the philosophic Scots
      mind,&rdquo; I interjected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was; even Mr. Macdonald thought it ingenious. &lsquo;And so,&rsquo; I went on, &lsquo;we
      were alive and awake and beginning to make history when you Scots were
      only bare-legged savages roaming over the hills and stealing cattle. It
      was a very bad habit of yours, that cattle-stealing, and one which you
      kept up too long.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;No worse a sin than your stealing land from the Indians,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh yes,&rsquo; I answered, &lsquo;because it was a smaller one! Yours was a vice,
      and ours a sin; or I mean it would have been a sin had we done it; but in
      reality we didn&rsquo;t steal land; we just TOOK it, reserving plenty for the
      Indians to play about on; and for every hunting-ground we took away we
      gave them in exchange a serviceable plough, or a school, or a nice Indian
      agent, or something. That was land-grabbing, if you like, but it is a
      habit you Britishers have still, while we gave it up when we reached years
      of discretion.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is very illuminating,&rdquo; I interrupted, now thoroughly wide awake,
      &ldquo;but it isn&rsquo;t my idea of a literary discussion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am coming to that,&rdquo; she responded. &ldquo;It was just at this point that,
      goaded into secret fury by my innocent speech about cattle-stealing, he
      began to belittle American literature, the poetry especially. Of course he
      waxed eloquent about the royal line of poet-kings that had made his
      country famous, and said the people who could claim Shakespeare had reason
      to be the proudest nation on earth. &lsquo;Doubtless,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;But do you mean
      to say that Scotland has any nearer claim upon Shakespeare than we have? I
      do not now allude to the fact that in the large sense he is the common
      property of the English-speaking world&rsquo; (Salemina told me to say that),
      &lsquo;but Shakespeare died in 1616, and the union of Scotland with England
      didn&rsquo;t come about till 1707, nearly a century afterwards. You really
      haven&rsquo;t anything to do with him! But as for us, we didn&rsquo;t leave England
      until 1620, when Shakespeare had been perfectly dead four years. We took
      very good care not to come away too soon. Chaucer and Spenser were dead
      too, and we had nothing to stay for!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was obliged to relax here and give vent to a burst of merriment at
      Francesca&rsquo;s absurdities.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could see that he had never regarded the matter in that light before,&rdquo;
       she went on gaily, encouraged by my laughter, &ldquo;but he braced himself for
      the conflict, and said &lsquo;I wonder that you didn&rsquo;t stay a little longer
      while you were about it. Milton and Ben Jonson were still alive; Bacon&rsquo;s
      Novum Organum was just coming out; and in thirty or forty years you could
      have had L&rsquo;Allegro, Il Penseroso and Paradise Lost; Newton&rsquo;s Principia,
      too, in 1687. Perhaps these were all too serious and heavy for your
      national taste; still one sometimes likes to claim things one cannot fully
      appreciate. And then, too, if you had once begun to stay, waiting for the
      great things to happen and the great books to be written, you would never
      have gone, for there would still have been Browning, Tennyson, and
      Swinburne to delay you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;If we couldn&rsquo;t stay to see out your great bards, we certainly couldn&rsquo;t
      afford to remain and welcome your minor ones,&rsquo; I answered frigidly; &lsquo;but
      we wanted to be well out of the way before England united with Scotland,
      knowing that if we were uncomfortable as things were, it would be a good
      deal worse after the Union; and we had to come home anyway, and start our
      own poets. Emerson, Whittier, Longfellow, Holmes, and Lowell had to be
      born.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I suppose they had to be if you had set your mind on it,&rsquo; he said,
      &lsquo;though personally I could have spared one or two on that roll of honour.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Very probably,&rsquo; I remarked, as thoroughly angry now as he intended I
      should be. &lsquo;We cannot expect you to appreciate all the American poets;
      indeed, you cannot appreciate all of your own, for the same nation doesn&rsquo;t
      always furnish the writers and the readers. Take your precious Browning,
      for example! There are hundreds of Browning Clubs in America, and I never
      heard of a single one in Scotland.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; he retorted, &lsquo;I dare say; but there is a good deal in belonging to
      a people who can understand him without clubs!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Francesca!&rdquo; I exclaimed, sitting bolt upright among my pillows. &ldquo;How
      could you give him that chance! How COULD you! What did you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said nothing,&rdquo; she replied mysteriously. &ldquo;I did something much more to
      the point,&mdash;I cried!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;CRIED?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, cried; not rivers and freshets of woe, but small brooks and
      streamlets of helpless mortification.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he do then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you say &lsquo;do&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I mean &lsquo;say,&rsquo; of course. Don&rsquo;t trifle; go on. What did he say then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are some things too dreadful to describe,&rdquo; she answered, and
      wrapping her Italian blanket majestically about her she retired to her own
      apartment, shooting one enigmatical glance at me as she closed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      That glance puzzled me for some time after she left the room. It was as
      expressive and interesting a beam as ever darted from a woman&rsquo;s eye. The
      combination of elements involved in it, if an abstract thing may be
      conceived as existing in component parts, was something like this:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      One-half, mystery. One-eighth, triumph. One-eighth, amusement.
      One-sixteenth, pride. One-sixteenth, shame. One-sixteenth, desire to
      confess. One-sixteenth, determination to conceal.
    </p>
    <p>
      And all these delicate, complex emotions played together in a circle of
      arching eyebrow, curving lip, and tremulous chin,&mdash;played together,
      mingling and melting into one another like fire and snow; bewildering,
      mystifying, enchanting the beholder!
    </p>
    <p>
      If Ronald Macdonald did&mdash;I am a woman, but, for one, I can hardly
      blame him!

      Chapter XXII. Francesca entertains the green-eyed monster.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;&ldquo;O has he chosen a bonny bride,
      An&rsquo; has he clean forgotten me?&rdquo;
     An&rsquo; sighing said that gay ladye,

      Lord Beichan.
    </p>
    <p>
      It rained in torrents; Salemina was darning stockings in the inglenook at
      Bide-a-Wee Cottage, and I was reading her a Scotch letter which Francesca
      and I had concocted the evening before. I proposed sending the document to
      certain chosen spirits in our own country, who were pleased to be
      facetious concerning our devotion to Scotland. It contained, in sooth,
      little that was new, and still less that was true, for we were confined to
      a very small vocabulary which we were obliged to supplement now and then
      by a dip into Burns and Allan Ramsay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is the letter:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bide-a-Wee Cottage, Pettybaw, East Neuk o&rsquo; Fife.
    </p>
    <p>
      To my trusty fieres,
    </p>
    <p>
      Mony&rsquo;s the time I hae ettled to send ye a screed, but there was aye
      something that cam&rsquo; i&rsquo; the gait. It wisna that I couldna be fashed, for
      aften hae I thocht o&rsquo; ye and my hairt has been wi&rsquo; ye mony&rsquo;s the day.
      There&rsquo;s no&rsquo; muckle fowk frae Ameriky hereawa; they&rsquo;re a&rsquo; jist Fife bodies,
      and a lass canna get her tongue roun&rsquo; their thrapple-taxin&rsquo; words ava&rsquo;, so
      it&rsquo;s like I may een drap a&rsquo; the sweetness o&rsquo; my good mither-tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tis a dulefu&rsquo; nicht, and an awfu&rsquo; blash is ragin&rsquo; wi&rsquo;oot. Fanny&rsquo;s awa&rsquo; at
      the gowff rinnin&rsquo; aboot wi&rsquo; a bag o&rsquo; sticks after a wee bit ba&rsquo;, and Sally
      and I are hame by oor lane. Laith will the lassie be to weet her bonny
      shoon, but lang ere the play&rsquo;ll be ower she&rsquo;ll wat her hat aboon. A gust
      o&rsquo; win&rsquo; is skirlin&rsquo; the noo, and as we luik ower the faem, the haar is
      risin&rsquo;, weetin&rsquo; the green swaird wi&rsquo; misty shoo&rsquo;rs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yestreen was a calm simmer gloamin&rsquo;, sae sweet an&rsquo; bonnie that when the
      sun was sinkin&rsquo; doon ower Pettybaw Sands we daundered ower the muir. As we
      cam&rsquo; through the scented birks, we saw a trottin&rsquo; burnie wimplin&rsquo; &lsquo;neath
      the white-blossomed slaes and hirplin&rsquo; doon the hillside; an&rsquo; while a
      herd-laddie lilted ower the fernie brae, a cushat cooed leesomely doon i&rsquo; 
      the dale. We pit aff oor shoon, sae blithe were we, kilted oor coats a
      little aboon the knee, and paidilt i&rsquo; the burn, gettin&rsquo; geyan weet the
      while. Then Sally pu&rsquo;d the gowans wat wi&rsquo; dew an&rsquo; twined her bree wi&rsquo; 
      tasselled broom, while I had a wee crackie wi&rsquo; Tibby Buchan, the flesher&rsquo;s
      dochter frae Auld Reekie. Tibby&rsquo;s nae giglet gawky like the lave, ye ken,&mdash;she&rsquo;s
      a sonsie maid, as sweet as ony hinny pear, wi&rsquo; her twa pawky een an&rsquo; her
      cockernony snooded up fu&rsquo; sleek.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were unco gleg to win hame when a&rsquo; this was dune, an&rsquo; after steekin&rsquo; 
      the door, to sit an&rsquo; birsle oor taes at the bit blaze. Mickle thocht we o&rsquo; 
      the gentles ayont the sea, an&rsquo; sair grat we for a&rsquo; frien&rsquo;s we kent lang
      syne in oor ain countree.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late at nicht, Fanny, the bonny gypsy, cam&rsquo; ben the hoose an&rsquo; tirled at
      the pin of oor bigly bower door, speirin&rsquo; for baps and bannocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hoots, lassie!&rdquo; cried oot Sally, &ldquo;th&rsquo; auld carline i&rsquo; the kitchen is i&rsquo; 
      her box-bed, an&rsquo; weel aneuch ye ken is lang syne cuddled doon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oo ay!&rdquo; said Fanny, strikin&rsquo; her curly pow, &ldquo;then fetch me parritch, an&rsquo; 
      dinna be lang wi&rsquo; them, for I&rsquo;ve lickit a Pettybaw lad at the gowff, an&rsquo; I
      could eat twa guid jints o&rsquo; beef gin I had them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Losh girl,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;gie ower makin&rsquo; sic a mickle din. Ye ken verra weel
      ye&rsquo;ll get nae parritch the nicht. I&rsquo;ll rin and fetch ye a &lsquo;piece&rsquo; to stap
      awee the soun&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blethers an&rsquo; havers!&rdquo; cried Fanny, but she blinkit bonnily the while, an&rsquo; 
      when the tea was weel maskit, she smoored her wrath an&rsquo; stappit her mooth
      wi&rsquo; a bit o&rsquo; oaten cake. We aye keep that i&rsquo; the hoose, for th&rsquo; auld
      servant-body is geyan bad at the cookin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; she&rsquo;s sae dour an&rsquo; dowie
      that to speak but till her we daur hardly mint.
    </p>
    <p>
      In sic divairsions pass the lang simmer days in braid Scotland, but I
      canna write mair the nicht, for &lsquo;tis the wee sma&rsquo; hours ayont the twal&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like th&rsquo; auld wife&rsquo;s parrot, &lsquo;we dinna speak muckle, but we&rsquo;re deevils to
      think,&rsquo; an&rsquo; we&rsquo;re aye thinkin&rsquo; aboot ye. An&rsquo; noo I maun leave ye to mak&rsquo; 
      what ye can oot o&rsquo; this, for I jalouse it&rsquo;ll pass ye to untaukle the whole
      hypothec.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fair fa&rsquo; ye a&rsquo;! Lang may yer lum reek, an&rsquo; may prosperity attend oor clan!
    </p>
    <p>
      Aye your gude frien&rsquo;,
    </p>
    <p>
      Penelope Hamilton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be very fine,&rdquo; remarked Salemina judicially, &ldquo;though I cannot
      understand more than half of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would also be true of Browning,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you love to see
      great ideas looming through a mist of words?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The words are misty enough in this case,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I do wish you
      would not tell the world that I paddle in the burn, or &lsquo;twine my bree wi&rsquo; 
      tasselled broom.&rsquo; I&rsquo;m too old to be made ridiculous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody will believe it,&rdquo; said Francesca, appearing in the doorway. &ldquo;They
      will know it is only Penelope&rsquo;s havering,&rdquo; and with this undeserved scoff,
      she took her mashie and went golfing&mdash;not on the links, on this
      occasion, but in our microscopic sitting-room. It is twelve feet square,
      and holds a tiny piano, desk, centre-table, sofa, and chairs, but the spot
      between the fire-place and the table is Francesca&rsquo;s favourite
      &lsquo;putting-green.&rsquo; She wishes to become more deadly in the matter of
      approaches, and thinks her tee-shots weak; so these two deficiencies she
      is trying to make good by home practice in inclement weather. She turns a
      tumbler on its side on the floor, and &lsquo;putts&rsquo; the ball into it, or at it,
      as the case may be, from the opposite side of the room. It is excellent
      discipline, and as the tumblers are inexpensive the breakage really does
      not matter. Whenever Miss Grieve hears the shivering of glass, she
      murmurs, not without reason, &lsquo;It is not for the knowing what they will be
      doing next.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Penelope, has it ever occurred to you that Elizabeth Ardmore is seriously
      interested in Mr. Macdonald?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Salemina propounded this question to me with the same innocence that a
      babe would display in placing a lighted fuse beside a dynamite bomb.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francesca naturally heard the remark,&mdash;although it was addressed to
      me,&mdash;pricked up her ears, and missed the tumbler by several feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a simple inquiry, but as I look back upon it from the safe ground
      of subsequent knowledge I perceive that it had a certain amount of
      influence upon Francesca&rsquo;s history. The suggestion would have carried no
      weight with me for two reasons. In the first place, Salemina is
      far-sighted. If objects are located at some distance from her, she sees
      them clearly; but if they are under her very nose she overlooks them
      altogether, unless they are sufficiently fragrant or audible to address
      other senses. This physical peculiarity she carries over into her mental
      processes. Her impression of the Disruption movement, for example, would
      be lively and distinct, but her perception of a contemporary lover&rsquo;s
      quarrel (particularly if it were fought at her own apron-strings) would be
      singularly vague. If she suggested, therefore, that Elizabeth Ardmore was
      interested in Mr. Beresford, who is the rightful captive of my bow and
      spear, I should be perfectly calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      My second reason for comfortable indifference is that frequently in
      novels, and always in plays, the heroine is instigated to violent jealousy
      by insinuations of this sort, usually conveyed by the villain of the
      piece, male or female. I have seen this happen so often in the modern
      drama that it has long since ceased to be convincing; but though Francesca
      has witnessed scores of plays and read hundreds of novels, it did not
      apparently strike her as a theatrical or literary suggestion that Lady
      Ardmore&rsquo;s daughter should be in love with Mr. Macdonald. The effect of the
      new point of view was most salutary, on the whole. She had come to think
      herself the only prominent figure in the Reverend Ronald&rsquo;s landscape, and
      anything more impertinent than her tone with him (unless it is his with
      her) I certainly never heard. This criticism, however, relates only to
      their public performances, and I have long suspected that their private
      conversations are of a kindlier character. When it occurred to her that he
      might simply be sharpening his mental sword on her steel, but that his
      heart had at last wandered into a more genial climate than she had ever
      provided for it, she softened unconsciously; the Scotsman and the American
      receded into a truer perspective, and the man and the woman approached
      each other with dangerous nearness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall we do if Francesca and Mr. Macdonald really fall in love with
      each other?&rdquo; asked Salemina, when Francesca had gone into the hall to try
      long drives. (There is a good deal of excitement in this, as Miss Grieve
      has to cross the passage on her way from the kitchen to the china-closet,
      and thus often serves as a reluctant &lsquo;hazard&rsquo; or &lsquo;bunker.&rsquo;)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean what should we have done?&rdquo; I queried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, don&rsquo;t be captious! It can&rsquo;t be too late yet. They have known
      each other only a little over two months; when would you have had me
      interfere, pray?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It depends upon what you expect to accomplish. If you wish to stop the
      marriage, interfere in a fortnight or so; if you wish to prevent an
      engagement, speak&mdash;well, say to-morrow; if, however, you didn&rsquo;t wish
      them to fall in love with each other, you should have kept one of them
      away from Lady Baird&rsquo;s dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could have waited a trifle longer than that,&rdquo; argued Salemina, &ldquo;for you
      remember how badly they got on at first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember you thought so,&rdquo; I responded dryly; &ldquo;but I believe Mr.
      Macdonald has been interested in Francesca from the outset, partly because
      her beauty and vivacity attracted him, partly because he could keep her in
      order only by putting his whole mind upon her. On his side, he has
      succeeded in piquing her into thinking of him continually, though solely,
      as she fancies, for the purpose of crossing swords with him. If they ever
      drop their weapons for an instant, and allow the din of warfare to subside
      so that they can listen to their own heart-beats, they will discover that
      they love each other to distraction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye ken mair than&rsquo;s in the catecheesm,&rdquo; remarked Salemina, yawning a
      little as she put away her darning-ball. &ldquo;It is pathetic to see you waste
      your time painting mediocre pictures, when as a lecturer upon love you
      could instruct your thousands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The thousands would never satisfy me,&rdquo; I retorted, &ldquo;so long as you
      remained uninstructed, for in your single person you would so swell the
      sum of human ignorance on that subject that my teaching would be for ever
      in vain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very clever indeed! Well, what will Mr. Monroe say to me when I return to
      New York without his daughter, or with his son-in-law?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has never denied Francesca anything in her life; why should he draw
      the line at a Scotsman? I am much more concerned about Mr. Macdonald&rsquo;s
      congregation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not anxious about that,&rdquo; said Salemina loyally. &ldquo;Francesca would be
      the life of an Inchcaldy parish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say,&rdquo; I observed, &ldquo;but she might be the death of the pastor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am ashamed of you, Penelope; or I should be if you meant what you say.
      She can make the people love her if she tries; when did she ever fail at
      that? But with Mr. Macdonald&rsquo;s talent, to say nothing of his family
      connections, he is sure to get a church in Edinburgh in a few years if he
      wishes. Undoubtedly, it would not be a great match in a money sense. I
      suppose he has a manse and three or four hundred pounds a year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That sum would do nicely for cabs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Penelope, you are flippant!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean it, dear; it&rsquo;s only for fun; and it would be so absurd if we
      should leave Francesca over here as the presiding genius of an Inchcaldy
      parsonage&mdash;I mean a manse!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t as if she were penniless,&rdquo; continued Salemina; &ldquo;she has fortune
      enough to assure her own independence, and not enough to threaten his&mdash;the
      ideal amount. I hardly think the good Lord&rsquo;s first intention was to make
      her a minister&rsquo;s wife, but He knows very well that Love is a master
      architect. Francesca is full of beautiful possibilities if Mr. Macdonald
      is the man to bring them out, and I am inclined to think he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has brought out impishness so far,&rdquo; I objected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The impishness is transitory,&rdquo; she returned, &ldquo;and I am speaking of
      permanent qualities. His is the stronger and more serious nature,
      Francesca&rsquo;s the sweeter and more flexible. He will be the oak-tree, and
      she will be the sunshine playing in the branches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Salemina, dear,&rdquo; I said penitently, kissing her grey hair, &ldquo;I apologise:
      you are not absolutely ignorant about Love, after all, when you call him
      the master architect; and that is very lovely and very true about the
      oak-tree and the sunshine.&rdquo;

    <p>
      Andrew Lammie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean Dalziel came to visit us a week ago, and has put new life into our
      little circle. I suppose it was playing &lsquo;Sir Patrick Spens&rsquo; that set us
      thinking about it, for one warm, idle day when we were all in the Glen we
      began a series of ballad-revels, in which each of us assumed a favourite
      character. The choice induced so much argument and disagreement that Mr.
      Beresford was at last appointed head of the clan; and having announced
      himself formally as The Mackintosh, he was placed on the summit of a
      hastily arranged pyramidal cairn. He was given an ash wand and a
      rowan-tree sword; and then, according to ancient custom, his pedigree and
      the exploits of his ancestors were recounted, and he was exhorted to
      emulate their example. Now it seems that a Highland chief of the olden
      time, being as absolute in his patriarchal authority as any prince, had a
      corresponding number of officers attached to his person. He had a
      bodyguard, who fought around him in battle, and independent of this he had
      a staff of officers who accompanied him wherever he went. These our chief
      proceeded to appoint as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Henchman, Ronald Macdonald; bard, Penelope Hamilton; spokesman or fool,
      Robin Anstruther; sword-bearer, Francesca Monroe; piper, Salemina; piper&rsquo;s
      attendant, Elizabeth Ardmore; baggage gillie, Jean Dalziel; running
      footman, Ralph; bridle gillie, Jamie; ford gillie, Miss Grieve. The ford
      gillie carries the chief across fords only, and there are no fords in the
      vicinity; so Mr. Beresford, not liking to leave a member of our household
      out of office, thought this the best post for Calamity Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      With The Mackintosh on his pyramidal cairn matters went very much better,
      and at Jamie&rsquo;s instigation we began to hold rehearsals for certain
      festivities at Rowardennan; for as Jamie&rsquo;s birthday fell on the eve of the
      Queen&rsquo;s Jubilee, there was to be a gay party at the Castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this occurred days ago, and yesterday evening the ballad-revels came
      off, and Rowardennan was a scene of great pageant and splendour. Lady
      Ardmore, dressed as the Lady of Inverleith, received the guests, and there
      were all manner of tableaux, and ballads in costume, and pantomimes, and a
      grand march by the clan, in which we appeared in our chosen roles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Salemina was Lady Maisry&mdash;she whom all the lords of the north
      countrie came wooing.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;But a&rsquo; that they could say to her,
     Her answer still was &ldquo;Na.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      And again:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;&ldquo;O haud your tongues, young men,&rdquo; she said,
      &ldquo;And think nae mair on me!&rdquo;&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      Mr. Beresford was Lord Beichan, and I was Shusy Pye
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;Lord Beichan was a Christian born,
     And such resolved to live and dee,
   So he was ta&rsquo;en by a savage Moor,
     Who treated him right cruellie.

   The Moor he had an only daughter,
     The damsel&rsquo;s name was Shusy Pye;
   And ilka day as she took the air

    <p>
      Elizabeth Ardmore was Leezie Lindsay, who kilted her coats o&rsquo; green satin
      to the knee and was aff to the Hielands so expeditiously when her lover
      declared himself to be &lsquo;Lord Ronald Macdonald, a chieftain of high
      degree.&rsquo;

    <p>
      Brenda Macrae from Pettybaw House was Fairly Fair; Jamie, Sir Patrick
      Spens; Ralph, King Alexander of Dunfermline; Mr. Anstruther, Bonnie
      Glenlogie, &lsquo;the flower o&rsquo; them a&rsquo;;&rsquo; Mr. Macdonald and Miss Dalziel, Young
      Hynde Horn and the king&rsquo;s daughter Jean respectively.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s Hynde Horn fair, and it&rsquo;s Hynde Horn free;
    Oh, where were you born, and in what countrie?&rdquo;
    &ldquo;In a far distant countrie I was born;
    But of home and friends I am quite forlorn.&rdquo;
 
    Oh, it&rsquo;s seven long years he served the king,
    But wages from him he ne&rsquo;er got a thing;
    Oh, it&rsquo;s seven long years he served, I ween,
    And all for love of the king&rsquo;s daughter Jean.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      It is not to be supposed that all this went off without any of the
      difficulties and heart-burnings that are incident to things dramatic. When
      Elizabeth Ardmore chose to be Leezie Lindsay, she asked me to sing the
      ballad behind the scenes. Mr. Beresford naturally thought that Mr.
      Macdonald would take the opposite part in the tableau, inasmuch as the
      hero bears his name; but he positively declined to play Lord Ronald
      Macdonald, and said it was altogether too personal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Anstruther was rather disagreeable at the beginning, and upbraided
      Miss Dalziel for offering to be the king&rsquo;s daughter Jean to Mr.
      Macdonald&rsquo;s Hynde Horn, when she knew very well he wanted her for Ladye
      Jeanie in Glenlogie. (She had meantime confided to me that nothing could
      induce her to appear in Glenlogie; it was far too personal.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Macdonald offended Francesca by sending her his cast-off gown and
      begging her to be Sir Patrick Spens; and she was still more gloomy (so I
      imagined) because he had not proffered his six feet of manly beauty for
      the part of the captain in Mary Ambree, when the only other person to take
      it was Jamie&rsquo;s tutor. He is an Oxford man and a delightful person, but
      very bow-legged; added to that, by the time the rehearsals had ended she
      had been obliged to beg him to love some one more worthy than herself, and
      did not wish to appear in the same tableau with him, feeling that it was
      much too personal.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the eventful hour came, yesterday, Willie and I were the only actors
      really willing to take lovers&rsquo; parts, save Jamie and Ralph, who were but
      too anxious to play all the characters, whatever their age, sex, colour,
      or relations. But the guests knew nothing of these trivial disagreements,
      and at ten o&rsquo;clock last night it would have been difficult to match
      Rowardennan Castle for a scene of beauty and revelry. Everything went
      merrily till we came to Hynde Horn, the concluding tableau, and the most
      effective and elaborate one on the programme. At the very last moment,
      when the opening scene was nearly ready, Jean Dalziel fell down a secret
      staircase that led from the tapestry chamber into Lady Ardmore&rsquo;s boudoir,
      where the rest of us were dressing. It was a short flight of steps, but as
      she held a candle, and was carrying her costume, she fell awkwardly,
      spraining her wrist and ankle. Finding that she was not maimed for life,
      Lady Ardmore turned with comical and unsympathetic haste to Francesca, so
      completely do amateur theatricals dry the milk of kindness in the human
      breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put on these clothes at once,&rdquo; she said imperiously, knowing nothing of
      the volcanoes beneath the surface. &ldquo;Hynde Horn is already on the stage,
      and somebody must be Jean. Take care of Miss Dalziel, girls, and ring for
      more maids. Helene, come and dress Miss Monroe; put on her slippers while
      I lace her gown; run and fetch more jewels,&mdash;more still,&mdash;she
      can carry off any number; not any rouge, Helene&mdash;she has too much
      colour now; pull the frock more off the shoulders&mdash;it&rsquo;s a pity to
      cover an inch of them; pile her hair higher&mdash;here, take my diamond
      tiara, child; hurry, Helene, fetch the silver cup and the cake&mdash;no,
      they are on the stage; take her train, Helene. Miss Hamilton, run and open
      the doors ahead of them, please. I won&rsquo;t go down for this tableau. I&rsquo;ll
      put Miss Dalziel right, and then I&rsquo;ll slip into the drawing-room, to be
      ready for the guests when they come in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We hurried breathlessly through an interminable series of rooms and
      corridors. I gave the signal to Mr. Beresford, who was nervously waiting
      for it in the wings, and the curtain went up on Hynde Horn disguised as
      the auld beggar man at the king&rsquo;s gate. Mr. Beresford was reading the
      ballad, and we took up the tableaux at the point where Hynde Horn has come
      from a far countrie to see why the diamonds in the ring given him by his
      own true love have grown pale and wan. He hears that the king&rsquo;s daughter
      Jean has been married to a knight these nine days past.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;But unto him a wife the bride winna be,
   For love of Hynde Horn, far over the sea.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      He therefore borrows the old beggar&rsquo;s garments and hobbles to the king&rsquo;s
      palace, where he petitions the porter for a cup of wine and a bit of cake
      to be handed him by the fair bride herself.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;&ldquo;Good porter, I pray, for Saints Peter and Paul,
    And for sake of the Saviour who died for us all,
    For one cup of wine and one bit of bread,
    To an auld man with travel and hunger bestead.

    And ask the fair bride, for the sake of Hynde Horn,
    To hand them to me so sadly forlorn.&rdquo;
     Then the porter for pity the message convey&rsquo;d,
    And told the fair bride all the beggar man said.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      The curtain went up again. The porter, moved to pity, has gone to give the
      message to his lady. Hynde Horn is watching the staircase at the rear of
      the stage, his heart in his eyes. The tapestries that hide it are drawn,
      and there stands the king&rsquo;s daughter, who tripped down the stair&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;And in her fair hands did lovingly bear
   A cup of red wine, and a farle of cake,
   To give the old man for loved Hynde Horn&rsquo;s sake.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      The hero of the ballad, who had not seen his true love for seven long
      years, could not have been more amazed at the change in her than was
      Ronald Macdonald at the sight of the flushed, excited, almost tearful
      king&rsquo;s daughter on the staircase, Lady Ardmore&rsquo;s diamonds flashing from
      her crimson satin gown, Lady Ardmore&rsquo;s rubies glowing on her white arms
      and throat; not Miss Dalziel, as had been arranged, but Francesca,
      rebellious, reluctant, embarrassed, angrily beautiful and beautifully
      angry!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the next scene Hynde Horn has drained the cup and dropped the ring into
      it.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;&ldquo;Oh, found you that ring by sea or on land,
    Or got you that ring off a dead man&rsquo;s hand?&rdquo;
    &ldquo;Oh, I found not that ring by sea or on land,
    But I got that ring from a fair lady&rsquo;s hand.

    As a pledge of true love she gave it to me,
    Full seven years ago as I sail&rsquo;d o&rsquo;er the sea;
    But now that the diamonds are changed in their hue,
    I know that my love has to me proved untrue.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      I never saw a prettier picture of sweet, tremulous womanhood, a more
      enchanting, breathing image of fidelity, than Francesca looked as Mr.
      Beresford read:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;&ldquo;Oh, I will cast off my gay costly gown,
    And follow thee on from town unto town;
    And I will take the gold kaims from my hair,
    And follow my true love for evermair.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      Whereupon Hynde Horn lets his beggar weeds fall, and shines there the
      foremost and noblest of all the king&rsquo;s companie as he says:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;&ldquo;You need not cast off your gay costly gown,
    To follow me on from town unto town;
    You need not take the gold kaims from your hair,
    For Hynde Horn has gold enough and to spare.&rdquo;
 
    Then the bridegrooms were changed, and the lady re-wed
    To Hynde Horn thus come back, like one from the dead.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      There is no doubt that this tableau gained the success of the evening, and
      the participants in it should have modestly and gratefully received the
      choruses of congratulation that were ready to be offered during the supper
      and dance that followed. Instead of that, what happened? Francesca drove
      home with Miss Dalziel before the quadrille d&rsquo;honneur, and when Willie
      bade me good night at the gate in the loaning, he said, &ldquo;I shall not be
      early to-morrow, dear. I am going to see Macdonald off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Off!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;Where is he going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only to Edinburgh and London, to stay till the last of next week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we may have left Pettybaw by that time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course; that is probably what he has in mind. But let me tell you
      this, Penelope: Macdonald is fathoms deep in love with Francesca, and if
      she trifles with him she shall know what I think of her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And let me tell you this, sir: Francesca is fathoms deep in love with
      Ronald Macdonald, little as you suspect it, and if he trifles with her he
      shall know what I think of him!&rdquo;

      The occupants of Bide-a-Wee Cottage awoke in anything but a Jubilee
      humour, next day. Willie had intended to come at nine, but of course did
      not appear. Francesca took her breakfast in bed, and came listlessly into
      the sitting-room at ten o&rsquo;clock, looking like a ghost. Jean&rsquo;s ankle was
      much better&mdash;the sprain proved to be not even a strain&mdash;but her
      wrist was painful. It was drizzling, too, and we had promised Miss Ardmore
      and Miss Macrae to aid with the last Jubilee decorations, the distribution
      of medals at the church, and the children&rsquo;s games and tea on the links in
      the afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have determined not to desert our beloved Pettybaw for the metropolis
      on this great day, but to celebrate it with the dear fowk o&rsquo; Fife who had
      grown to be a part of our lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bide-a-Wee Cottage does not occupy an imposing position in the landscape,
      and the choice of art fabrics at the Pettybaw draper&rsquo;s is small, but the
      moment it should stop raining we were intending to carry out a dazzling
      scheme of decoration that would proclaim our affectionate respect for the
      &lsquo;little lady in black&rsquo; on her Diamond Jubilee. But would it stop raining?&mdash;that
      was the question. The draper wasna certain that so licht a shoo&rsquo;r could
      richtly be called rain. The village weans were yearning for the hour to
      arrive when they might sit on the wet golf-course and have tea;
      manifestly, therefore, it could not be a bad day for Scotland; but if it
      should grow worse, what would become of our mammoth subscription bonfire
      on Pettybaw Law&mdash;the bonfire that Brenda Macrae was to light, as the
      lady of the manor?
    </p>
    <p>
      There were no deputations to request the honour of Miss Macrae&rsquo;s
      distinguished services on this occasion; that is not the way the
      self-respecting villager comports himself in Fifeshire. The chairman of
      the local committee, a respectable gardener, called upon Miss Macrae at
      Pettybaw House, and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sent to tell ye ye&rsquo;re to have the pleasure
      an&rsquo; the honour of lichtin&rsquo; the bonfire the nicht! Ay, it&rsquo;s a grand chance
      ye&rsquo;re havin&rsquo;, miss, ye&rsquo;ll remember it as long as ye live, I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When I complimented this rugged soul on his decoration of the triumphal
      arch under which the school-children were to pass, I said, &ldquo;I think if her
      Majesty could see it, she would be pleased with our village to-day,
      James.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, ye&rsquo;re richt, miss,&rdquo; he replied complacently. &ldquo;She&rsquo;d see that
      Inchcawdy canna compeer wi&rsquo; us; we&rsquo;ve patronised her weel in Pettybaw!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Truly, as Stevenson says, &lsquo;he who goes fishing among the Scots peasantry
      with condescension for a bait will have an empty basket by evening.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At eleven o&rsquo;clock a boy arrived at Bide-a-Wee with an interesting-looking
      package, which I promptly opened. That dear foolish lover of mine (whose
      foolishness is one of the most adorable things about him) makes me only
      two visits a day, and is therefore constrained to send me some reminder of
      himself in the intervening hours, or minutes&mdash;a book, a flower, or a
      note. Uncovering the pretty box, I found a long, slender&mdash;something&mdash;of
      sparkling silver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; I exclaimed, holding it up. &ldquo;It is too long and not wide
      enough for a paper-knife, although it would be famous for cutting
      magazines. Is it a baton? Where did Willie find it, and what can it be?
      There is something engraved on one side, something that looks like birds
      on a twig,&mdash;yes, three little birds; and see the lovely cairngorm set
      in the end! Oh, it has words cut in it: &lsquo;To Jean: From Hynde Horn&rsquo;&mdash;Goodness
      me! I&rsquo;ve opened Miss Dalziel&rsquo;s package!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Francesca made a sudden swooping motion, and caught box, cover, and
      contents in her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is mine! I know it is mine!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You really ought not to claim
      everything that is sent to the house, Penelope&mdash;as if nobody had any
      friends or presents but you!&rdquo; and she rushed upstairs like a whirlwind.
    </p>
    <p>
      I examined the outside wrapper, lying on the floor, and found, to my
      chagrin, that it did bear Miss Monroe&rsquo;s name, somewhat blotted by the
      rain; but if the box were addressed to her, why was the silver thing
      inscribed to Miss Dalziel? Well, Francesca would explain the mystery
      within the hour, unless she had become a changed being.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fifteen minutes passed. Salemina was making Jubilee sandwiches at Pettybaw
      House, Miss Dalziel was asleep in her room, I was being devoured slowly by
      curiosity, when Francesca came down without a word, walked out of the
      front door, went up to the main street, and entered the village
      post-office without so much as a backward glance. She was a changed being,
      then! I might as well be living in a Gaboriau novel, I thought, and went
      up into my little painting and writing room to address a programme of the
      Pettybaw celebration to Lady Baird, watch for the glimpse of Willie coming
      down the loaning, and see if I could discover where Francesca went from
      the post-office.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sitting down by my desk, I could find neither my wax nor my silver
      candlestick, my scissors nor my ball of twine. Plainly Francesca had been
      on one of her borrowing tours; and she had left an additional trace of
      herself&mdash;if one were needed&mdash;in a book of old Scottish ballads,
      open at &lsquo;Hynde Horn.&rsquo; I glanced at it idly while I was waiting for her to
      return. I was not familiar with the opening verses, and these were the
      first lines that met my eye:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;Oh, he gave to his love a silver wand,
   Her sceptre of rule over fair Scotland;
   With three singing laverocks set thereon
   For to mind her of him when he was gone.

   And his love gave to him a gay gold ring
   With three shining diamonds set therein;
   Oh, his love gave to him this gay gold ring,
   Of virtue and value above all thing.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      A light dawned upon me! The silver mystery, then, was intended for a wand&mdash;and
      a very pretty way of making love to an American girl, too, to call it a
      &lsquo;sceptre of rule over fair Scotland&rsquo;; and the three birds were three
      singing laverocks &lsquo;to mind her of him when he was gone&rsquo;!
    </p>
    <p>
      But the real Hynde Horn in the dear old ballad had a truelove who was not
      captious and capricious and cold like Francesca. His love gave him a gay
      gold ring&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;Of virtue and value above all thing.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      Yet stay: behind the ballad book flung heedlessly on my desk was&mdash;what
      should it be but the little morocco case, empty now, in which our
      Francesca keeps her dead mother&rsquo;s engagement ring&mdash;the mother who
      died when she was a wee child. Truly a very pretty modern ballad to be
      sung in these unromantic, degenerate days!
    </p>
    <p>
      Francesca came in at the door behind me, saw her secret reflected in my
      tell-tale face, saw the sympathetic moisture in my eyes, and, flinging
      herself into my willing arms, burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Pen, dear, dear Pen, I am so miserable and so happy; so afraid that he
      won&rsquo;t come back, so frightened for fear that he will! I sent him away
      because there were so many lions in the path, and I didn&rsquo;t know how to
      slay them. I thought of my f-father; I thought of my c-c-country. I didn&rsquo;t
      want to live with him in Scotland, I knew that I couldn&rsquo;t live without him
      in America, and there I was! I didn&rsquo;t think I was s-suited to a minister,
      and I am not; but oh! this p-particular minister is so s-suited to me!&rdquo;
       and she threw herself on the sofa and buried her head in the cushions.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was so absurd even in her grief that I had hard work to keep from
      smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us talk about the lions,&rdquo; I said soothingly. &ldquo;But when did the
      trouble begin? When did he speak to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After the tableau last night; but of course there had been other&mdash;other&mdash;times&mdash;and
      things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had told me a week before that he should go away for a while, that it
      made him too wretched to stay here just now; and I suppose that was when
      he got the silver wand ready for me. It was meant for the Jean of the
      poem, you know. Of course he would not put my own name on a gift like
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think he had it made for Jean Dalziel in the first place?&rdquo;&mdash;I
      asked this, thinking she needed some sort of tonic in her relaxed
      condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know him better than that, Penelope! I am ashamed of you! We had read
      Hynde Horn together ages before Jean Dalziel came; but I imagine, when we
      came to acting the lines, he thought it would be better to have some other
      king&rsquo;s daughter; that is, that it would be less personal. And I never,
      never would have been in the tableau, if I had dared refuse Lady Ardmore,
      or could have explained; but I had no time to think. And then, naturally,
      he thought by me being there as the king&rsquo;s daughter that&mdash;that&mdash;the
      lions were slain, you know; instead of which they were roaring so that I
      could hardly hear the orchestra.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Francesca, look me in the eye! Do&mdash;you&mdash;love him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love him? I adore him!&rdquo; she exclaimed in good clear decisive English, as
      she rose impetuously and paced up and down in front of the sofa. &ldquo;But in
      the first place there is the difference in nationality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no patience with you. One would think he was a Turk, an Esquimau,
      or a cannibal. He is white, he speaks English, and he believes in the
      Christian religion. The idea of calling such a man a foreigner!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it didn&rsquo;t prevent me from loving him,&rdquo; she confessed, &ldquo;but I thought
      at first it would be unpatriotic to marry him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you think Columbia could not spare you even as a rare specimen to be
      used for exhibition purposes?&rdquo; I asked wickedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know I am not so conceited as that! No,&rdquo; she continued ingenuously,
      &ldquo;I feared that if I accepted him it would look, over here, as if the
      home-supply of husbands were of inferior quality; and then we had such
      disagreeable discussions at the beginning, I simply could not bear to
      leave my nice new free country, and ally myself with his aeons of tiresome
      history. But it came to me in the night, a week ago, that after all I
      should hate a man who didn&rsquo;t love his Fatherland; and in the illumination
      of that new idea Ronald&rsquo;s character assumed a different outline in my
      mind. How could he love America when he had never seen it? How could I
      convince him that American women are the most charming in the world in any
      better way than by letting him live under the same roof with a good
      example? How could I expect him to let me love my country best unless I
      permitted him to love his best?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t offer so many apologies for your infatuation, my dear,&rdquo; I
      answered dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not apologising for it!&rdquo; she exclaimed impulsively. &ldquo;Oh, if you
      could only keep it to yourself, I should like to tell you how I trust and
      admire and reverence Ronald Macdonald, but of course you will repeat
      everything to Willie Beresford within the hour! You think he has gone on
      and on loving me against his better judgment. You believe he has fought
      against it because of my unfitness, but that I, poor, weak, trivial thing,
      am not capable of deep feeling and that I shall never appreciate the
      sacrifices he makes in choosing me! Very well, then, I tell you plainly
      that if I had to live in a damp manse the rest of my life, drink tea and
      eat scones for breakfast, and&mdash;and buy my hats of the Inchcaldy
      milliner, I should still glory in the possibility of being Ronald
      Macdonald&rsquo;s wife&mdash;a possibility hourly growing more uncertain, I am
      sorry to say!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the extreme aversion with which you began,&rdquo; I asked&mdash;&ldquo;what has
      become of that, and when did it begin to turn in the opposite direction?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aversion!&rdquo; she cried, with convincing and unblushing candour. &ldquo;That
      aversion was a cover, clapped on to keep my self-respect warm. I abused
      him a good deal, it is true, because it was so delightful to hear you and
      Salemina take his part. Sometimes I trembled for fear you would agree with
      me, but you never did. The more I criticised him, the louder you sang his
      praises&mdash;it was lovely! The fact is&mdash;we might as well throw
      light upon the whole matter, and then never allude to it again; and if you
      tell Willie Beresford, you shall never visit my manse, nor see me preside
      at my mothers&rsquo; meetings, nor hear me address the infant class in the
      Sunday-school&mdash;the fact is, I liked him from the beginning at Lady
      Baird&rsquo;s dinner. I liked the bow he made when he offered me his arm (I wish
      it had been his hand); I liked the top of his head when it was bowed; I
      liked his arm when I took it; I liked the height of his shoulder when I
      stood beside it; I liked the way he put me in my chair (that showed
      chivalry), and unfolded his napkin (that was neat and business-like), and
      pushed aside all his wine-glasses but one (that was temperate); I liked
      the side view of his nose, the shape of his collar, the cleanness of his
      shave, the manliness of his tone&mdash;oh, I liked him altogether, you
      must know how it is, Penelope&mdash;the goodness and strength and
      simplicity that radiated from him. And when he said, within the first
      half-hour, that international alliances presented even more difficulties
      to the imagination than others, I felt, to my confusion, a distinct sense
      of disappointment. Even while I was quarrelling with him, I said to
      myself, &lsquo;Poor darling, you cannot have him even if you should want him, so
      don&rsquo;t look at him much!&rsquo;&mdash;But I did look at him; and what is worse,
      he looked at me; and what is worse yet, he curled himself so tightly round
      my heart that if he takes himself away, I shall be cold the rest of my
      life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are really sure of your love this time, and you have never
      advised him to wed somebody more worthy than yourself?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I!&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t put such an idea into his head for
      worlds! He might adopt it!&rdquo;

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;Pale and wan was she when Glenlogie gaed ben,
   But red rosy grew she whene&rsquo;er he sat doun.
</pre>
    <p>
      Glenlogie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just here the front door banged, and a manly step sounded on the stair.
      Francesca sat up straight in a big chair, and dried her eyes hastily with
      her poor little wet ball of a handkerchief; for she knows that Willie is a
      privileged visitor in my studio. The door opened (it was ajar) and Ronald
      Macdonald strode into the room. I hope I may never have the same sense of
      nothingness again! To be young, pleasing, gifted, and to be regarded no
      more than a fly upon the wall, is death to one&rsquo;s self-respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dropped on one knee beside Francesca, and took her two hands in his
      without removing his gaze from her speaking face. She burned, but did not
      flinch under the ordeal. The colour leaped into her cheeks. Love swam in
      her tears, but was not drowned there; it was too strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you mean it?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him, trembling, as she said, &ldquo;I meant every word, and far,
      far more. I meant all that a girl can say to a man when she loves him, and
      wants to be everything she is capable of being to him, to his work, to his
      people, and to his&mdash;country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even this brief colloquy had been embarrassing, but I knew that worse was
      still to come and could not be delayed much longer, so I left the room
      hastily and with no attempt at apology&mdash;not that they minded my
      presence in the least, or observed my exit, though I was obliged to leap
      over Mr. Macdonald&rsquo;s feet in passing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found Mr. Beresford sitting on the stairs, in the lower hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Willie, you angel, you idol, where did you find him?&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I went into the post-office, an hour ago,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I met
      Francesca. She asked me for Macdonald&rsquo;s Edinburgh address, saying she had
      something that belonged to him and wished to send it after him. I offered
      to address the package and see that it reached him as expeditiously as
      possible. &lsquo;That is what I wish,&rdquo; she said, with elaborate formality. &lsquo;This
      is something I have just discovered, something he needs very much,
      something he does not know he has left behind.&rsquo; I did not think it best to
      tell her at the moment that Macdonald had not yet deserted Inchcaldy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Willie, you have the quickest intelligence and the most exquisite insight
      of any man I ever met!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the fact was that I had been to see him off, and found him detained
      by the sudden illness of one of his elders. I rode over again to take him
      the little parcel. Of course I don&rsquo;t know what it contained; by its size
      and shape I should judge it might be a thimble, or a collar-button, or a
      sixpence; but, at all events, he must have needed the thing, for he
      certainly did not let the grass grow under his feet after he received it!
      Let us go into the sitting-room until they come down,&mdash;as they will
      have to, poor wretches, sooner or later; I know that I am always being
      brought down against my will. Salemina wants your advice about the number
      of her Majesty&rsquo;s portraits to be hung on the front of the cottage, and the
      number of candles to be placed in each window.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a half-hour later when Mr. Macdonald came into the room, and,
      walking directly up to Salemina, kissed her hand respectfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Salemina,&rdquo; he said, with evident emotion, &ldquo;I want to borrow one of
      your national jewels for my Queen&rsquo;s crown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what will our President say to lose a jewel from his crown?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good republican rulers do not wear coronets, as a matter of principle,&rdquo;
       he argued; &ldquo;but in truth I fear I am not thinking of her Majesty&mdash;God
      bless her! This gem is not entirely for state occasions.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;&ldquo;I would wear it in my bosom,
    Lest my jewel I should tine.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      It is the crowning of my own life rather than that of the British Empire
      that engages my present thought. Will you intercede for me with
      Francesca&rsquo;s father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this is the end of all your international bickering?&rdquo; Salemina asked
      teasingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;we have buried the hatchet, signed articles of
      agreement, made treaties of international comity. Francesca stays over
      here as a kind of missionary to Scotland, so she says, or as a feminine
      diplomat; she wishes to be on hand to enforce the Monroe Doctrine
      properly, in case her government&rsquo;s accredited ambassadors relax in the
      performance of their duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Salemina!&rdquo; called a laughing voice outside the door. &ldquo;I am won&rsquo;erful
      lifted up. You will be a prood woman the day, for I am now Estaiblished!&rdquo;
       and Francesca, clad in Miss Grieve&rsquo;s Sunday bonnet, shawl, and black
      cotton gloves, entered, and curtsied demurely to the floor. She held, as
      corroborative detail, a life of John Knox in her hand, and anything more
      incongruous than her sparkling eyes and mutinous mouth under the
      melancholy head-gear can hardly be imagined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am now Estaiblished,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Div ye ken the new asseestant frae
      Inchcawdy pairish? I&rsquo;m the mon&rsquo; (a second deep curtsy here). &ldquo;I trust,
      leddies, that ye&rsquo;ll mak&rsquo; the maist o&rsquo; your releegious preevileges, an&rsquo; 
      that ye&rsquo;ll be constant at the kurruk.&mdash;Have you given papa&rsquo;s consent,
      Salemina? And isn&rsquo;t it dreadful that he is Scotch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it dreadful that she is not?&rdquo; asked Mr. Macdonald. &ldquo;Yet to my mind
      no woman in Scotland is half as lovable as she!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And no man in America begins to compare with him,&rdquo; Francesca confessed
      sadly. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it pitiful that out of the millions of our own countrypeople
      we couldn&rsquo;t have found somebody that would do? What do you think now, Lord
      Ronald Macdonald, of these dangerous international alliances?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never understood that speech of mine,&rdquo; he replied, with prompt
      mendacity. &ldquo;When I said that international marriages presented more
      difficulties to the imagination than others, I was thinking of your
      marriage and mine, and that, I knew from the first moment I saw you, would
      be extremely difficult to arrange!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      Chapter XXVI. &lsquo;Scotland&rsquo;s burning! Look out!&rsquo; 
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;And soon a score of fires, I ween,
   From height, and hill, and cliff were seen;
      . . . . . . .
   Each after each they glanced to sight,
   As stars arise upon the night,
   They gleamed on many a dusky tarn,
   Haunted by the lonely earn;
   On many a cairn&rsquo;s grey pyramid,
   Where urns of mighty chiefs lie hid.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      The Lay of the Last Minstrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rain continued at intervals throughout the day, but as the afternoon
      wore on the skies looked a trifle more hopeful. It would be &lsquo;saft,&rsquo; no
      doubt, climbing the Law, but the bonfire must be lighted. Would Pettybaw
      be behind London? Would Pettybaw desert the Queen in her hour of need? Not
      though the rain were bursting the well-heads on Cawda; not though the
      swollen mountain burns drowned us to the knee! So off we started as the
      short midsummer night descended.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were to climb the Law, wait for the signal from Cawda&rsquo;s lonely height,
      and then fire Pettybaw&rsquo;s torch of loyalty to the little lady in black; not
      a blaze flaming out war and rumours of war, as was the beacon-fire on the
      old grey battlements of Edinburgh Castle in the days of yore, but a
      message of peace and good-will. Pausing at a hut on the side of the great
      green mountain, we looked north toward Helva, white-crested with a wreath
      of vapour. (You need not look on your map of Scotland for Cawda and Helva,
      for you will not find them any more than you will find Pettybaw and
      Inchcaldy.) One by one the tops of the distant hills began to clear, and
      with the glass we could discern the bonfire cairns up-built here and there
      for Scotland&rsquo;s evening sacrifice of love and fealty. Cawda was still
      veiled, and Cawda was to give the signal for all the smaller fires.
      Pettybaw&rsquo;s, I suppose, was counted as a flash in the pan, but not one of
      the hundred patriots climbing the mountain-side would have acknowledged
      it; to us the good name of the kingdom of Fife and the glory of the
      British Empire depended on Pettybaw fire. Some of us had misgivings, too,&mdash;misgivings
      founded upon Miss Grieve&rsquo;s dismal prophecies. She had agreed to put nine
      lighted candles in each of our cottage windows at ten o&rsquo;clock, but had
      declined to go out of her kitchen to see a procession, hear a band, or
      look at a bonfire. She had had a fair sickenin&rsquo; day, an amount of work too
      wearifu&rsquo; for one person by her lane. She hoped that the bonfire wasna
      built o&rsquo; Mrs. Sinkler&rsquo;s coals nor Mr. Macbrose&rsquo;s kindlings, nor soaked
      with Mr. Cameron&rsquo;s paraffin; and she finished with the customary, but
      irrelative and exasperating, allusion to the exceedingly nice family with
      whom she had live in Glasgy.
    </p>
    <p>
      And still we toiled upward, keeping our doubts to ourselves. Jean was
      limping bravely, supported by Robin Anstruther&rsquo;s arm. Mr. Macdonald was
      ardently helping Francesca, who can climb like a chamois, but would
      doubtless rather be assisted. Her gypsy face shone radiant out of her
      black cloth hood, and Ronald&rsquo;s was no less luminous. I have never seen two
      beings more love-daft. They comport themselves as if they had read the
      manuscript of the tender passion, and were moving in exalted superiority
      through a less favoured world,&mdash;a world waiting impatiently for the
      first number of the story to come out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still we climbed, and as we approached the Grey Lady (a curious rock very
      near the summit) somebody proposed three cheers for the Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      How the children hurrahed,&mdash;for the infant heart is easily inflamed,&mdash;and
      how their shrill Jubilee slogan pierced the mystery of the night, and went
      rolling on from glen to glen to the Firth of Forth itself! Then there was
      a shout from the rocketmen far out on the open moor,&mdash;&lsquo;Cawda&rsquo;s clear!
      Cawda&rsquo;s clear!&rsquo; Back against a silver sky stood the signal pile, and
      signal rockets flashed upward, to be answered from all the surrounding
      hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now to light our own fire. One of the village committee solemnly took off
      his hat and poured on oil. The great moment had come. Brenda Macrae
      approached the sacred pile, and, tremulous from the effect of much
      contradictory advice, applied the torch. Silence, thou Grieve and others,
      false prophets of disaster! Who now could say that Pettybaw bonfire had
      been badly built, or that its fifteen tons of coal and twenty cords of
      wood had been unphilosophically heaped together?
    </p>
    <p>
      The flames rushed toward the sky with ruddy blaze, shining with weird
      effect against the black fir-trees and the blacker night. Three cheers
      more! God save the Queen! May she reign over us, happy and glorious! And
      we cheered lustily, too, you may be sure! It was more for the woman than
      the monarch; it was for the blameless life, not for the splendid monarchy;
      but there was everything hearty, and nothing alien in our tone, when we
      sang &lsquo;God save the Queen&rsquo; with the rest of the Pettybaw villagers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The land darkened; the wind blew chill. Willie, Mr. Macdonald, and Mr.
      Anstruther brought rugs, and found a sheltered nook for us where we might
      still watch the scene. There we sat, looking at the plains below, with all
      the village streets sparkling with light, with rockets shooting into the
      air and falling to earth in golden rain, with red lights flickering on the
      grey lakes, and with one beacon-fire after another gleaming from the
      hilltops, till we could count more than fifty answering one another from
      the wooded crests along the shore, some of them piercing the rifts of
      low-lying clouds till they seemed to be burning in mid-heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then one by one the distant fires faded, and as some of us still sat there
      silently, far, far away in the grey east there was a faint flush of
      carmine where the new dawn was kindling in secret. Underneath that violet
      bank of cloud the sun was forging his beams of light. The pole-star paled.
      The breath of the new morrow stole up out of the rosy grey. The wings of
      the morning stirred and trembled; and in the darkness and chill and
      mysterious awakening eyes looked into other eyes, hand sought hand, and
      cheeks touched each other in mute caress.

  &lsquo;Sun, gallop down the westlin skies,

</pre>
    <p>
      The Gentle Shepherd.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every noon, during this last week, as we have wended our way up the
      loaning to the Pettybaw inn for our luncheon, we have passed three magpies
      sitting together on the topmost rail of the fence. I am not prepared to
      state that they were always the same magpies; I only know there were
      always three of them. We have just discovered what they were about, and
      great is the excitement in our little circle. I am to be married
      to-morrow, and married in Pettybaw, and Miss Grieve says that in Scotland
      the number of magpies one sees is of infinite significance: that one means
      sorrow; two, mirth; three, a marriage; four, a birth, and we now recall as
      corroborative detail that we saw one magpie, our first, on the afternoon
      of her arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Beresford has been cabled for, and must return to America at once on
      important business. He persuaded me that the Atlantic is an ower large
      body of water to roll between two lovers, and I agreed with all my heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      A wedding was arranged, mostly by telegraph, in six hours. The Reverend
      Ronald and the Friar are to perform the ceremony; a dear old painter
      friend of mine, a London R.A., will come to give me away; Francesca will
      be my maid of honour; Elizabeth Ardmore and Jean Dalziel, my bridemaidens;
      Robin Anstruther, the best man; while Jamie and Ralph will be kilted
      pages-in-waiting, and Lady Ardmore will give the breakfast at the Castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never was there such generosity, such hospitality, such wealth of
      friendship! True, I have no wedding finery; but as I am perforce a
      Scottish bride, I can be married in the white gown with the silver
      thistles in which I went to Holyrood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Anstruther took a night train to and from London to choose the
      bouquets and bridal souvenirs. Lady Baird has sent the veil, and a
      wonderful diamond thistle to pin it on,&mdash;a jewel fit for a princess!
      With the dear Dominie&rsquo;s note promising to be an usher came an antique
      silver casket filled with white heather. And as for the bride-cake, it is
      one of Salemina&rsquo;s gifts, chosen as much in a spirit of fun as affection.
      It is surely appropriate for this American wedding transplanted to
      Scottish soil, and what should it be but a model, in fairy icing, of Sir
      Walter&rsquo;s beautiful monument in Princes Street! Of course Francesca is full
      of nonsensical quips about it, and says that the Edinburgh jail would have
      been just as fine architecturally (it is, in truth, a building beautiful
      enough to tempt an aesthete to crime), and a much more fitting symbol for
      a wedding-cake, unless, indeed, she adds, Salemina intends her gift to be
      a monument to my folly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pettybaw kirk is trimmed with yellow broom from these dear Scottish banks
      and braes; and waving their green fans and plumes up and down the aisle
      where I shall walk a bride, are tall ferns and bracken from Crummylowe
      Glen, where we played ballads.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I look back upon it, the life here has been all a ballad from first to
      last. Like the elfin Tam Lin,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &lsquo;The queen o&rsquo; fairies she caught me
     In this green hill to dwell,&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      and these hasty nuptials are a fittingly romantic ending to the summer&rsquo;s
      poetry. I am in a mood, were it necessary, to be &lsquo;ta&rsquo;en by the milk-white
      hand,&rsquo; lifted to a pillion on a coal-black charger, and spirited &lsquo;o&rsquo;er the
      border an&rsquo; awa&rsquo;&rsquo; by my dear Jock o&rsquo; Hazeldean. Unhappily, all is quite
      regular and aboveboard; no &lsquo;lord o&rsquo; Langley dale&rsquo; contests the prize with
      the bridegroom, but the marriage is at least unique and unconventional; no
      one can rob me of that sweet consolation.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the Foundation&rdquo;
 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg&rdquo; is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, &ldquo;Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;
 
- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
